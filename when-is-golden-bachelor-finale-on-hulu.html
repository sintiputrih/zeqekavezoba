Just stay chill, and let the streaming saga unfold!</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Gerry previously admitted that dating was challenging for him.</h2><p>Ahead of the finale, Gerry spoke with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a> about his dating history and revealed that he had quite a difficult time putting himself out there after the devastating death of his wife, Toni, in 2017.</p><p>"I've dated a number of times since Toni's passed, more recently than back closer to when she's passed," he told the outlet. “For one reason or another, the attempts didn't work out."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>He figured he would be ready for a new relationship after a year of grieving the death of his high school sweetheart, but it didn't work out that way. Gerry told People, "Every time I thought I was ready, I realized I wasn't. Somehow I got it in my head that if you grieve for a year, that at the end of the year, you should be OK. It absolutely wasn't the case."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>After nearly three years, Gerry met with a grief counselor: "It was a difficult time," he explained. "I finally decided, 'It's time for me to go see a grief counselor,' because I wasn't sure I was on track. I wasn't sure I was mending properly. It was probably a life changer for me because I remember having two sessions with the counselor, and he goes, 'You're fine. You just got to give yourself credit for being OK.'"</p><p>Gerry eventually "became more optimistic about dating, and it helped," even though it didn't lead to any long-term relationships. He then became discouraged and felt he would never find love again, but with the Golden Bachelor finale imminent, Gerry teased everything "worked out" for him in the end.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWmuoyiqmafn6GxprqMm5icoJWhvLN5xaKlmqSVYryveceuo64%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogInfo - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
