See that’s the thing I don’t have any problems with NOBODY!” she wrote. “Im probably the only female artist that always show love to all the female artist. No jealousy No insecurities over here. I’m actually ya favorite fave … FAVE. Don’t let that go over ya head. (Jokes Up).”</p><p>In a separate comment, she added: “What’s the REAL problem? My choice. My opinion of who I said the queen is. The fuck y’all think this is. A fuckn colt. Now pls leave me alone. I hate coming on here talking to y’all. Bye.”</p><p>You can see the post, comments inclusive, below.</p><p></p><p>Trina’s original comments, made at Atlanta’s ONE Musicfest in October, were published on Wednesday (December 27).</p><p>When asked who’s responsible for <a class=underline-link href=# rel=noopener>female rappers’ current dominance</a>, she told DX: “Beyoncé because she is the No. 1 female rapper when she does rap. There’s no sleeping on the Queen.</p><p>“It’s just one of those things. Like, of course, this is the Queen Beyoncé but when you hear her do a song and it’s rapping involved it’s like, ‘Oh my God.’ It’s just more inspiration.”</p><p>She added: “It’s just a good thing. I feel like for the girls now, when you hear ’em and look at ’em it’s just all different kind of music and it all sounds different.”</p><p>Trina’s comments almost immediately drew the ire of Nicki Minaj’s Barbz fanbase, who took her praise of Beyoncé as a slight against the self-proclaimed Queen of Rap.</p><p>However, <a class=underline-link href=# rel=noopener>the rap veteran wasn’t deterred by the backlash and doubled down on her stance</a>.</p><a class=related-article--container href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.hiphopdx.com/2023/12/trina-talks-first-meeting-lil-wayne-explains-missy-elliott-studio-brilliance-250x142.jpg alt="Trina Talks First Meeting Lil Wayne & Explains Missy Elliott’s Studio Brilliance" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=related-article--tagline>related<span> news</span></p><h3 class=related-article--title>Trina Talks First Meeting Lil Wayne & Explains Missy Elliott’s Studio Brilliance</h3><p class=related-article--meta-information>December 26, 2023</p></a><p>“For the dusty crusty funky bitches in the bacccckkkk,” she wrote on her Instagram Stories with yelling emojis. “Beyoncé is the queen of rap (when she raps) and ALL other genres of music. Now stay mad goofy’s I said what I said and NAAN bitch gone check me [middle finger emoji] carry on!”</p><p>As the story picked up steam, with multiple outlets sharing the DX&nbsp;clip, Trina offered a much more serious response on her main&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram page</a> alongside a photo of Beyoncé.</p><p>“Now that I have y’all undivided attention [double exclamation point emoji] I am actually late to the party bcuz I wasn’t aware of this nonsense happening today bcuz Im too busy minding my business,” she started.</p><p>“Let me just make myself CLEAR once again, since it’s a slow day for the blogs and bullshit, this interview was back in October at The One Music Festival.. I rlly don’t give a rats ass how anybody feel, I said what I said .. that’s the Queen Bey and I’m gonna STAN [bee emoji] on that.”</p><p>She continued: “Beyonce is the Queen of rap (when she raps) and ALL genres of music when it comes to me [double exclamation point emoji] go argue with the IRS or somebody else idc and that’s not up for debate over here. So run along and enjoy the rest of y’all day. (And make sure to clean behind y’all sofas before the New Year).”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmigmaW1sLzDsWWcp51ku6bD0mirq6GelnqvtcKkoGalmaOuq3nBnpyfZZKaxrC6wp5kqq2Vmrtuu8VmqZqo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogInfo - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
