This is like your hair mask – it is designed to improve your nail health.”</p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">View post on Instagram</a>&nbsp;<p id=eaeQFJnvWsQN data-wc=78>“The technician then assesses your nail type and chooses the correct base to suit your nail type. Think of it like face cream, you wouldn’t use the same cream for skin that is combination, sensitive or dry. By choosing the right base product it means your nails last for up to three weeks with no chipping and lifting. A Bio Sculpture manicure lasts as they can change the base to suit your nail type to ensure maximum longevity."</p><p id=e7B3Kd1VwWfY data-wc=10><strong>MORE: <a class=hm-link href=#>Princess Kate's TikTok-approved Easter service manicure was so unexpected</a></strong></p><p id=eQ_tpp1Zda0X data-wc=10><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Nude nails: 10 designs to inspire your next manicure</a></p><h2 dir=ltr>How long does Bio Sculpture take to apply?</h2><p id=eYF63NhMOU-3 data-wc=13>"We recommend 45 minutes to ensure a thorough cuticle prep and beautiful application."&nbsp;</p><h2 dir=ltr>Is Bio Sculpture better than Shellac for your nails?</h2><p id=eLEPVJyl4kN6 data-wc=25>According to Bio Sculpture the manicures are "superior to traditional gel manicures" as they treat your nail, last longer and add strength to your nail.&nbsp;</p><h2 dir=ltr>How do you remove Bio Sculpture?</h2><p id=eB-ox_Vk_qaR data-wc=23>To remove bio sculpture, “Simply soak it off with gel remover and foil wraps,” says Venetia.
