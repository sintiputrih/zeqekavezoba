She became a nationally known children’s clothing designer in her twenties and evolved into a world-renowned crystal couture designer and popular television personality. She graduated from New York’s Fashion Institute of Technology and worked as an apprentice in Italy, France, England, Switzerland, Sweden, and Denmark. From there, she went on to work at several prestigious fashion houses in New York, Italy, and Hong Kong while earning numerous awards along the way. In 1984, she established her own company called, The Sondra Celli Company, where she designs uncommon custom Swarovski crystal couture wears for infants, children and women. Her work has been seen in Town & Country, Vogue, Harper’s Bazaar, New York Magazine, The New York Times, The Boston Globe, The Sun and The Huffington Post. Her wedding dresses have been showcased on TLC’s My Big Fat American Gypsy Wedding and its spinoff, Gypsy Sisters. TLC also developed a series of specials called Bling It On that was created to showcase Celli’s line of custom Crystal couture. Celli currently resides in Boston and has been creating wedding gowns for American gypsies for 33 years. She says the average gypsy will spend between $5,000 and $9,000 for their dresses, but if the groom comes into more money during the process, the bride will add more to the dress.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKufo7GzrYycnKWkmah6r7HTZq6oqqSdeqO1zqCpmqiYrnqkrdGenKtlkayus7DSZp2am6Rirq%2BwjKWgn51dqMGwvtho</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogInfo - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
