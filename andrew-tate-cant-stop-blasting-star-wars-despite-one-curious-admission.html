All of this anti-Star Wars sentiment from the great Tate — I use the word “great” here sarcastically — is despite the fact that he has never seen a single Star Wars film. Imagine that? He talks more about Star Wars than even some Star Wars fans do — ok, that’s a lie — but he certainly can’t keep Star Wars out of his millennium falcon mouth.<br></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Still never seen Star Wars. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/9FbiDTOaj8</a></p>— The Real World (@therealworld_hq) <a href=#>November 6, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=106 data-current-count=406 data-injectable=true>He even posted about it from his Real World account last week, and then from his personal account today.<br></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Still haven’t watched Star Wars.</p><p>And my life continues getting better.</p>— Andrew Tate (@Cobratate) <a href=#>November 14, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=441 data-current-count=741 data-injectable=true>Maybe he feels this way because women in Star Wars are fairly powerful. Hair-bunned Princess Leia wouldn’t hesitate to smack a man with her buns, Rey could defeat anyone, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Shin Hati</a> eats Jedi for brunch. Tate knows that this would likely annoy him, as he would prefer to see Leia cooking dinner, Rey doing laundry, and Shin raising kids as a stay-at-home wife, which is fairly absurd considering <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">she can’t even stay in her own galaxy</a>.</p><p data-characters=394 data-current-count=394 data-injectable=false>The funniest thing about all of it is that, if you think about it, Tate’s type of woman is really Aunt Beru. She cooks meals for Uncle Owen, pours that blue milk rather nicely, cooks those desert-farmed vegetables perfectly, while softly advising her husband to set Luke free. She watches after the home while Luke and her husband go shopping for droids that speak Bocce. What a homely woman!</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=694 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=120 data-current-count=120 data-injectable=false>Of course, she ultimately gets burned to death at home by stormtroopers, which would never happen to Leia, Rey, or Hati.</p><p data-characters=212 data-current-count=332 data-injectable=false>So, maybe Andrew Tate should watch Star Wars just so that he knows what he’s talking about. He can’t, however, because millionaires don’t have time to watch things created by billionaires like George Lucas.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2Sur7DRnq5mrJGpsm6vwKerZqukpL1ursuaqq2hnpx6tMDAq2SwmaKoeqWx0qmgrZ1dpLumecKuqaKnpah6orDMoqqsoZ%2BjfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogInfo - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
