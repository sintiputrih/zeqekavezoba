The brunette beauty took to Instagram to share the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>sexy photos</a> and captioned it, “JM.” In the carousel of photos, Tracee took a dip in the crystal blue water in Oracabessa, a small town in Saint Mary Parish in Jamaica, and looked over her shoulder to deliver the ultimate vacation goals snapshot. Her raven-hued tresses were worn slick back and wet, as she rose from the water in style. Finally, her look was complete with a white manicure.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Many of Tracee’s 11.1 million followers took to the comments section to gush over her look, including some celebrity pals like&nbsp;Russian Doll&nbsp;star&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Natasha Lyonne</strong></a>, 43. “Splish splash!!”, the actress commented along with flame emoji. Even&nbsp;Orange Is the New Black&nbsp;actress&nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Uzo Aduba</a>&nbsp;</strong>couldn’t help but praise Tracee for looking so good. “Chocolate dipped,” she wrote.&nbsp;Glass Onion&nbsp;star&nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Kate Hudson</a>&nbsp;</strong>also chimed in to compliment her pal. “Oh how I miss that spot!!! Enjoy. The best place,” the 43-year-old penned.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>The&nbsp;Girlfriends&nbsp;actress clearly showed that hard work pays off, as she’s recently been posting a series of videos of her in <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>the gym</a>. “Up and at ‘em,” she captioned a <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Nov. 28 clip</a> of her working out with celebrity trainer <b>Jason </b><strong><span class="_aacl _aacp _aacw _aacx _aad7 _aade">Walsh.</span></strong><span class="_aacl _aacp _aacw _aacx _aad7 _aade"> More recently, on Dec. 11, the 50-year-old took to Instagram to reveal that she processes some emotion through <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>physical exercise</a>. “Opening up physically can also mean opening up emotionally or vice versa. The practice of growing and healing is holistic for me. It happens by allowing vulnerability and I utilize many different modalities and practices,” she captioned <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>the video</a>.</span><strong><br></strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/tracee-ellis-ross-bikini-spl-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>Tracee’s vacation snapshots also come just four days after she graced the cover of <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Purist&nbsp;</a>for the magazine’s winter issue. In her interview for the outlet, the cover model opened up to editor,&nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Cristina Cuomo</a>&nbsp;</strong>about self-care and more. “I feel like at this age I have amassed so many different tools and modalities of how to navigate this crazy, wonderful thing that is life, that is not a movie,” the Pattern Beauty founder shared. “It’s not a fairy tale, and the real thing requires community, support, a lot of baths, therapy, exercise, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>meditation</a>, really good sleep, a lot more water than I think anybody sets out to think you should be drinking in a day.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Later, the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Emmy-nominee</a> told the outlet about how she feels at <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>50 years old</a>. “At 50, you do a lot of taking stock. I feel like it’s a privilege to be able to get older, to be able to be here and actually have realized that some of the stuff I’ve done has worked,” Tracee gushed. The starlet celebrated her <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>50th birthday</a> on Oct. 29, and took to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> to share a powerful message.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>“If you had told me that in my twenties, in my teens, that I was going to be somebody that actually could do scary things… that I could be comfortable even when I was uncomfortable,” she began. “…That I could live life on life’s terms. That I could intuitively handle situations which used to baffle me. That I have an unbreakable and unshakable foundation for life underneath me, I would’ve said there’s no way.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH5ze5FpZq2qkZiypnnEpaOiq12nvLS%2FjJ%2BjqKqRoXqjtcqipaJlmpa6orXCmmSpoJ%2BpvLR7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogInfo - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
