The mysterious man, Kevin, joined her during the stream to discuss “spicy topics” before playing Teamfight Tactics.</p><p>Pokimane’s <a href=#>relationship status</a> has been the topic of discussion throughout the year within her community. However, she has been tight-lipped about her private life despite comments she made including her possibly <a href=#>dating a fan</a>.</p><h2>Is the mystery man Pokimane's new boyfriend?</h2><p>During a <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">livestream</a> on 30th December 2021, Pokimane invited Kevin to join her onstream for some lighthearted and “spicy” conversations. Before welcoming him, she did black out her screen before reappearing with Kevin and coffee onstream</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ginx.tv/imgcdn/hhgqhPWffsJHqCec3R8UxODsxDfnPDpU96k5nD2uzWE/rs:fill:0:0:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ2lueC50di91cGxvYWRzMi9Ud2l0Y2gvcG9raS9wb2tpbWFuZS1teXN0ZXJ5LW1hbi1rZXZpbi0xLXR3aXRjaC5KUEc><p>The presence of this mysterious man had her followers speculating that he may be the streamer’s secret boyfriend. There isn’t much we know about the mystery man, however, he left quite the impression with her community with his charming personality.</p><p>What sent her community into a frenzy was when he asked whether he and Pokimane are “dating or siblings?” While this may have not confirmed whether the pair are officially dating, it was apparent during his time with the Twitch streamer that they have chemistry that was visible onstream.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ginx.tv/imgcdn/iPCm4e35uf9O_BzedbK8DLgc3PC2N4jw96XltERecng/rs:fill:0:0:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ2lueC50di91cGxvYWRzMi9Ud2l0Y2gvcG9raS9wb2tpbWFuZS1teXN0ZXJ5LW1hbi1rZXZpbi0yLXR3aXRjaC5KUEc><p>One follower suggested that Kevin is very “nice” for allowing “his sister to stream” with him before asking if she does “anything interesting”? Kevin appeared to have not taken this as a joke was cut off by Pokimane who proceeded to let him know that the follower was just trolling.</p><p>“Oh no, it’s just a joke. Don’t get defensive. He’s joking and I’m okay with it,” Pokimane exclaimed. It wasn’t long before she laughed it off while Kevin remained perplexed over the comment.</p><p>Sometime after he left, Pokimane briefly explained what really annoys her when her personal life gets brought up.</p><p>“I think the weird thing about, sometimes, introducing people to stream or to others is like people can have recently entered your life and you could still be getting to know them.” She further elaborated on when people ask her the“are you dating right now?” question to which she responded, “I don’t know his favourite colour.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ginx.tv/imgcdn/lx0aJs1RCbpwVn4OELIxEJaB-8NxXijVAsvcZ9e1BkY/rs:fill:0:0:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ2lueC50di91cGxvYWRzMi9Ud2l0Y2gvcG9raS9wb2tpbWFuZS1teXN0ZXJ5LW1hbi1rZXZpbi0zLXR3aXRjaC5KUEc><p>While there will be plenty of chatter on Pokimane’s relationship status and who Kevin is to her, don’t expect her to say anything more about her private life for a while.</p><p>Don’t forget to check out o<a href=#>ur dedicated Twitch section for the latest news, updates, streamer antics, drama</a> and more.</p><p>Featured image courtesy of Twitter / Pokimane.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ginx.tv/imgcdn/WHWtXVSzrVzTYycMiaj1FX6kFo_a6ycmm_zEeM34Avk/rs:fill:180:180:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ2lueC50di91cGxvYWRzMi8xX1N0YWZmX1Bob3Rvcy9hc2hsZWlnaF9rbGVpbi5qcGc alt="Ashleigh Klein" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXNsWWtrl%2Bau3DA1qKrnKBfmbalec%2BooqKlkaOybr7Er5yapF2dsrN50p6aq52kYq%2BwxcWroJ6mlGLDqq2MmmStr5mpsKl50q2pnpmd</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogInfo - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
