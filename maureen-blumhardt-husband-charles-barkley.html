Eleven times selected an NBA All-Star, the prototypical power forward won the 1993 NBA Most Valuable Player award. He has previously worked for a few prestigious networks and is presently an NBA commentator.</strong></p><p>In addition to his prosperous career both before and after retirement, Charley has a lovely marriage to Maureen Blumhardt, his wife of more than thirty years. The famous couple never paid attention to what other people thought and constantly tried to show that their love was strong enough to overcome any obstacles, even if their interracial marriage first caused a lot of controversy. They have a grown daughter as well.</p><h2><span id=Who_Is_Maureen_Blumhardt_the_Wife_of_Charles_Barkley>Who Is Maureen Blumhardt, the Wife of Charles Barkley?</span></h2><p>Former model Maureen (also known as Maureen Lynn Blumhardt) was employed by weight reduction companies. She used to work for legal assistance as well. There isn’t any more information available on her career achievements.</p><p>Even though Maureen is the wife of a famous basketball star, she stays out of the spotlight. However, her spouse Charley is a well-known figure in the public eye.</p><h2><span id=Early_Life_and_Age_Her_Siblings8217_Specifics>Early Life and Age: Her Siblings’ Specifics</span></h2><p>On January 1, 1964, in the United States of America, Maureen Blumhardt was born.

On social media, she has posted a few images of her siblings.</p><p>Nevertheless, a number of his early details—including her parents’ information—are absent.</p><p>Charles Barkley and I were married in a courthouse basement after a long marriage.</p><p>In February 1989, Maureen and her husband exchanged vows. Without any witnesses, the couple exchanged vows in a low-key civil wedding in the Elkton, Maryland courtroom basement.</p><p>There were around twenty guests in the waiting room to meet Charles and his wife as the ceremony was coming to a conclusion. In the end, the two also agreed to take a few pictures.</p><p>Going back to their initial encounter, it was in the 1980s City Avenue eatery in Pennsylvania when the two crossed paths. Barkley was a player for the Philadelphia 76ers at the time, and Maureen, his future wife, was employed by legal assistance.

He told the Chicago Tribune that when he was at home, he felt calm and at ease.</p><p>I enjoy spending time by myself at home since I never feel at peace while I’m out in public. Maureen believes I may be dull at times. But leaving the house is nearly difficult. Peace does not come to you. You so find yourself spending all of your time at home. You are safe and secure at home, where no one can harm you or get to you.</p><h2><span id=Right_now_Maureen_Blumhardt_resides_in_a_28_million_home>Right now, Maureen Blumhardt resides in a $2.8 million home.</span></h2><p>Blumhardt presently resides in Scottsdale’s Gainey Ranch, a metro Phoenix neighborhood.
