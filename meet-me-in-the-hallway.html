It also connotes addiction and could perhaps be referencing the somewhat unhealthy relationship between Harry and the other person as he seems so dependent upon them.</p><p>The line, "I just left your bedroom" implies Harry has just been with whoever the song is directed towards; perhaps the pain he is referring to is the absence of the other person since they have just parted, which is supported in the concept of meeting in a hallway as if they want to spend as much time as they can together and their separation huts him. The morphine could also be representing the person themselves, and how they are ridding Harry of his pain.</p><p>He is also shown as hopeful, hence: "Just let me know I'll be at the door, at the door/Hoping you'll come around" which could either be Harry claiming he will wait at his own door in case the other shows up or expressing his eagerness to return to the other person if they change their mind, with "come around" meaning to concede or be persuaded to Harry's point of view.</p><p>The imperative phrase, "Just let me know" shows that the other person is the one in control and with power over the situation, perhaps the one to end the relationship.</p><p>"I'll be on the floor," suggests a rather pessimistic view of the future from Harry's perspective, showing his desperation and how weak he feels in the other's absence, implying that they make him strong. In fact, the One Direction song, 'Strong' seems to fit quite appropriately with this one and since 'Strong' appears to reference his suspected relationship with Louis Tomlinson, it would lead me to believe that this does also.</p><p>It could be argued that this is also hinted to in the lines "We don't talk about it/ It's something we don't do". This may be suggesting that they are still in regular contact but that there is a lot that goes unspoken, which links to most of the lines in 'Two Ghosts' which is also speculated to be about Louis. Another interpretation of this line is that the two are continuing to be in a relationship - or at least having secret little rendezvous in the hallway - since it is in present tense but that it is an unspoken agreement. Maybe this is because they know each other well enough to understand each other without needing to discuss it, however it could be due to shame or embarrassment.</p><p>Furthermore, the uncertainty of their predicament is expressed in the line, "Maybe we'll work it out" perhaps showing Harry's denial and reluctance to accept that a relationship is over or simply that the two have encountered an issue but he still remains hopeful of resolving it.</p><p>The writers use an extended metaphor of illness to represent the pain Harry is feeling after having parted ways - whether geographically or in the termination of a relationship. This is portrayed through the mention of morphine combined with the line "I gotta get better" which also suggests a toxicity to their relationship. This could be simply unrequited love which one might infer from the pronoun "I" suggesting that the his love and/or pain is not reciprocated. It could also refer to Harry being overly reliant upon the other person as he describes the pain similarly to withdrawal and hints at addiction as I mentioned previously. Even in the last verse this is shown in the lines, "'Cause once you go without it/ Nothing else will do".</p><p>Nonetheless, the lyrics are powerful and portray a fierce passion throughout. Harry depicts a vigorous love through the desperation and emptiness that accompanies the lack of it in this beautifully crafted account that contrasts greatly to the blur of shallow pop lyrics that overshadow much of today's music.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rcXRopqipqSav7G%2BxK2YraGfo8Bvr86mZqGZoqfGbr%2FTsqOeq1%2BisqbAjKacZqGeYsGpsYyhmKWkp5bG</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogInfo - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
