The prestigious NASCAR Cup Series race will emanate from the Daytona International Speedway in Daytona Beach, Florida, on February 18. The race will air at 2:30 p.m. ET on FOX.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>2024 was been a remarkable year for Johnson. On January 23, he was <a href=#>added to the TKO Board of Directors</a>, and he gained ownership of “The Rock” name. This came after he made a surprise appearance at WWE RAW Day One earlier in the month. On the first RAW of the year, he delivered an electrifying tease about a potential dream match against Roman Reigns.</p><p>As of this writing, there is no word on when The Rock will return to WWE programming.</p><h2 id=h-dwayne-johnson-on-owning-the-rock-name>Dwayne Johnson On Owning ‘The Rock’ Name</h2><p>Dwayne Johnson <a href=#>recently discussed</a> how much gaining ownership of “The Rock”:” name meant to him. Speaking on&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">CNBC’s Squawk On The Street</a>, he explained why it was so special.</p><p>“There’s the business side of that, as we we know. There’s the economic side of that. But also, it goes much deeper than that. This idea, the name of The Rock, for me, I owe that name everything. Without that name, there would be no wrestling career, there would be no Hollywood career. But also, that name was a derivative name of my dad, Rocky Johnson. He was the first black tag team champions in WWE, a trailblazer, paved the way, man of color, for a kid like me to be embraced in a bigger way when I came along. So this is one of the reasons why this deal is so unprecedented, the one that I was able to do, along with Ari here.”</p><p>“The street valuation of the name The Rock, it’s got some heft behind it, but more important than that, it’s something that I earned, I built, and I owe so much to that wild lunatic called The Rock. By the way, I told [Ari] this last night. The greatest benefit of now completely owning the name The Rock, no gimmicks, no BS, across the board, full ownership, is the name The Rock years ago, really allowed me to be me, and that’s very special.”</p><p>Click <a href=#>here </a>to see what The Rock had to say about potentially facing Roman Reigns.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZNtZ2xrZGLBqbGMq6aco12Wu6%2B71KeanpxdlsBus9GapZ1lnZa%2FtLTApWSfp6Jif3F%2Bk2abmrGkpLuieZRpZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogInfo - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
