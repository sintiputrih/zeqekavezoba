He was still the&nbsp;<a href=#>new comedy boom</a>’s&nbsp;Comic Most Likely to Succeed, a title reinforced by his acclaimed 2012 Comedy Central stand-up special&nbsp;New in Town&nbsp;— which was enjoying a phenomenal second life after its release on Netflix — and his unusually publicized stint as a writer at&nbsp;Saturday Night Live&nbsp;(it helps when you co-create Stefon). He was being compared to Jerry Seinfeld, favorably; and it was fitting, then, that his career was about to culminate with the impending early October release of the eponymous multi-camera Fox sitcom he created.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjggl56dg00hg3k6266jmclf3@published data-word-count=66>Then reviews started coming out for&nbsp;Mulaney, and the comic was once again being compared to Jerry Seinfeld — but this time unfavorably. When the ratings ended up equally underwhelming, Fox reduced the episode order. Though the show wasn’t officially canceled until the spring, the writing was on the wall in the first few weeks. For many people, that was the last time they’ve heard from Mulaney.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjggl56dg00hh3k625359ayah@published data-word-count=101>But he’s been busy, doing the thing that drew so many people to him in the first place: stand-up. Still one of the sharpest joke-writers of his generation, Mulaney’s act is now richer and more universal. He didn’t lose a step while working on the sitcom; he gained a few, and that new gait is on full display in his new special,&nbsp;The Comeback Kid, which premieres on Netflix on Friday. Then, starting in December, he’ll be treading the boards with longtime friend and collaborator Nick Kroll, as the two stage an Off Broadway version of their two-person character routine, “Oh, Hello.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjggl56dh00hi3k62f40uaw6v@published data-word-count=77>In advance of this new culmination, Vulture sat down with the comedian in a Manhattan hotel room hours before his show in Montclair, New Jersey, to discuss the past year, which has been the most challenging, frustrating, and rewarding one of his career. The talk covered the “exhilarating” week when everyone was trashing him, the advice he got from comedy legends like Seinfeld and Lorne Michaels, and how, through all of it, he’s grown as a comedian.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjggkuo3d003x3k62u536h9eh@published data-word-count=18><strong>The material you’re currently using on tour — is it the same as what’s in the new special?&nbsp;</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjggnlh6600133k62waniegfe@published data-word-count=48>Plus a little new [material].&nbsp;People haven’t seen it yet, so why would I not do it?

However, Larry had been a writer, and I have to say, it was like, “Who’s going to do the Q&A? Who would be good at that? Tom Hanks was so good at the 25th. Seinfeld would be great at that. He’s done more stuff on&nbsp;SNL&nbsp;in the past few years.” And then, as it came together, it was like,&nbsp;“Wait, is Larry going to be there?” I wouldn’t say organic. It is produced show-business. But it was a very cool coming together.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjggkul4p001a3k62e9hkr8vs@published data-word-count=5><strong>Had you met Jerry before?&nbsp;</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjggkvvxw004w3k62x82p2opj@published data-word-count=64>No, never. I had never met him. I had been afraid to meet him, or just intimidated to meet him. It was incredibly exciting. The 40th was such a swirling series of events. It was like a college reunion for everyone. It was doing the show with everyone, plus everyone you grew up with, plus people you never even met when you worked there.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjggkulao001c3k621w2uu14u@published data-word-count=97>It was such overstimulation, to the point that on Friday night, I was going to rehearse with Seinfeld at something like 11 p.m. I had to go to dinner with a friend downtown. So it’s eight o’clock, and I’m like, “I can make dinner and get back for Seinfeld.” I’m in the hallway, and I hear Paul McCartney warming up on the piano with “Long and Winding Road,” and I thought,&nbsp;I don’t have time for that.&nbsp;That’s how overstimulating it was:&nbsp;I would love to watch that, but I just can’t right now. There is too much going on.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjggkular001d3k62dk1jcu0z@published data-word-count=69>I got a photo a couple of months after from the staff photographer. It’s the Sunday-afternoon rehearsal, and it’s me and Larry and Jerry, and the three of us are talking over the script. I got it in the mail and I was like,&nbsp;Oh my God.&nbsp;I had no idea we had ever been in the same positioning like that, or that the photo was taken. It was really cool.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjggkulat001e3k62p8bhonsa@published data-word-count=37><strong>There are similarities between you and Jerry.

I emailed him a first draft of it.&nbsp;Saturday Night Live,&nbsp;it’s very assumed that a first draft ain’t perfect. But I tried to get it into the shape I would send something to Jerry Seinfeld in. I just wrote, “By the way, I think very highly of you, so please do not criticize this too harshly.” And he wrote back, “Funny stuff. I think we’ll be able to make something work.” And he added, “This is going to be huge … for you.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjggkulb0001f3k62x25o8fss@published data-word-count=7><strong>Had he known about your work before?</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjggkw1ia00563k62b0nt4pkn@published data-word-count=25>Yes. That also made it a very nice and bizarre footnote. I don’t know if you know this, but I had a show on Fox.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjggkulbe001g3k62o7cl1m6n@published data-word-count=5><strong>[Laughs.] I heard about it.</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjggkw3nf005b3k62ru8gso4b@published data-word-count=84>No one knows this, but the last episode of that show aired the same night as the 40th.&nbsp;<a href=#>The 40th did better</a>. But, of all the weird timing, I was talking to Seinfeld that weekend about it all. That was a very, very nice conversation to have. I remember thinking,&nbsp;Well, that’s the end of a tale.Like, I met him and he had some very encouraging, very kind things to say. It was so exciting and kind of — in my own small world — poignant.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjggkulbl001h3k6229h66nxd@published data-word-count=4><strong>What did he say?</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjggkwda6005g3k629wiqckv1@published data-word-count=90>It was about the mechanics of running a show. It was really nice to talk to him a little about how that can be a real grind. To be able to talk to&nbsp;him, with both of us going, “It’s the&nbsp;worst,” was very cathartic. He was like, “You starred in and wrote and produced your own network show. Well, it’s me and you and only a few other people who have done that.” He was saying, be happy with that accomplishment — or that&nbsp;is&nbsp;an accomplishment. He knew it wasn’t going well.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjggkulgi001i3k625v2mc1qj@published data-word-count=11><strong>Did you know the show was getting canceled at that point?&nbsp;</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjggkwfjf005l3k62c0tgubm0@published data-word-count=14>In February?&nbsp;Yes. It was canceled. It hadn’t been announced, but it was.

There’s momentary relief in not having to&nbsp;run a network show seven days a week. Momentary. But not really. It was very frustrating and disappointing not being able to go back to work with everyone. It was like on a Friday. I had a table-read Monday with some guest roles I was so excited about, and a script another writer and I had worked on all week. The tea leaves were pointing there for sure, but the moment it happened, it was more frustration that I wasn’t going to be able to go back and do it.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjggkulgp001j3k62is1biyql@published data-word-count=8><strong>Because you were focused on creating the thing.&nbsp;</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjggkwopo005v3k62f0y813st@published data-word-count=40>As poorly as it was being received, we were still making the show. That engine of producing it was helping me get through some of that. Then it was suddenly like, “By the way, that’s over, too.” It was difficult.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjggkulgp001k3k62ww4wi465@published data-word-count=5><strong>Did you read the reviews?</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjggkwqwi00603k62djio4t66@published data-word-count=1>Sure.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjggkulh5001m3k62wyp3ar55@published data-word-count=35><strong>I felt like I got what you were doing, but it seemed like a lot of the reviews didn’t.

I kept thinking,&nbsp;If only they knew. Can we move this episode up, and then they can see that I’m trying to do X and Y?</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjggkulhd001n3k62ofr4kflj@published data-word-count=153>In retrospect, obviously, it wasn’t fun to get bad reviews, but I don’t have any feeling that it’s an injustice. I have a real respect for when the audience goes, “Nope.” I really do. There is something very democratic and cool about it. We worked so hard on it. I put my name on it. It was my first big thing, and&nbsp;boy, oh boy, do I wish this will work, but who cares? You put it out, and it works or it doesn’t. It’s a network-TV show. People don’t have some mandate to hear me out. They saw the entertainment. That would be like bombing at a stand-up club and then being like, “I want you all to come home with me. See what a nice guy I am. See how I take care of my dog. And then you’ll all like me more, and then we can go back to the club.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjggkulmi001o3k62clmn6rx7@published data-word-count=6><strong>What do you think was miscommunicated?</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjggkww1a006a3k62zmq41yky@published data-word-count=159>One thing that was helpful — and one thing I learned running a show — was figuring out what wasn’t my job. There are so many things you can take on. You could say, “I don’t love the props. I’m going to start coming in earlier and making sure all of the props are whatever.” But one thing I do have to say is it’s not my job is to critique it. I wouldn’t presume to know. I could go on for hours, but when people don’t like something, they don’t like it. Sometimes I — with comedy, it’s like someone liking you in high school. They either do or they&nbsp;don’t.&nbsp;And when they don’t, they&nbsp;don’t. And that’s it. There are no appeals. You show up, and you’re like, “Hi! I’m —” and you stumble and they’re like, “It’s over.” I know that’s part of it. People turned it on, and if they didn’t like it, they didn’t like it.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjggkulmo001p3k62kyjgprhf@published data-word-count=16><strong>Do you think the&nbsp;<span class="clay-annotated kiln-phrase" aria-describedby=annotation-5 tabindex=0>multi-camera sitcom</span> is just a format that can’t be pushed to something weirder?</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjggkwy6b006f3k62ryans1yg@published data-word-count=75>No, no, no, no. When I said it’s not my job to critique the show, there are things — tonal things — that I know, if I did it again, I would adjust. They’re not huge, and they’re not all that interesting. But, no, you can totally do it, and I think&nbsp;The Carmichael Show&nbsp;is an example of, like, a really smart comic and smart writers, and setting up a show that can live that way.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjggkulmz001q3k62ssavi39j@published data-word-count=7><strong>It’s slower and kind of Norman Lear–y</strong>.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjggkx044006k3k62cab7x0en@published data-word-count=45>I saw it and thought it was really funny. I love Jerrod [Carmichael]. I recognize it’s being received well. And that’s great. One thing that was a bummer about my own show’s reception was that I did feel like,&nbsp;Oh I hope people keep making multi-cams.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjggkuln3001r3k62ccuak9sd@published data-word-count=12><strong>Would you have done something different if you could do it again?</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjggkx266006p3k629g55spun@published data-word-count=44>If I had to go back, I would have made the show I made because I wanted to make that show.

Oh, that thing I didn’t like, I could have avoided that.&nbsp;Or,&nbsp;This thing&nbsp;I really wanted&nbsp;to try, I could have tried that.&nbsp;It’s like running like a huge Rube Goldberg machine, those comical machines with levers and arms that grab things.

I don’t think we had a family dinner where one didn’t come up. I still think about the OJ trial several times a week. Bill Clinton fascinates me because at the time, it seemed like his shenanigans and the people after him were the biggest political stories you could ever imagine. I remember when the Starr Report was published in the newspaper, all of us were reading it in the high-school cafeteria, and a dean started taking the newspapers away from us. There was crazy stuff in it. It was like explicit and hilarious. Everything about that time felt huge. It was like, “Wow, I’ll never see divisiveness like this again.” And then you look back after what&nbsp;has&nbsp;happened, and it all seems so quaint. I think between OJ and the various Clinton scandals, we were never so entertained.

Also, like, last night, I landed in Roanoke, drove to Virginia Tech, and did a show, and I remember thinking,&nbsp;This is going to be really fun, but I’m glad I have a lot of written material because my brain’s a little dead.&nbsp;The show was actually pretty improvised and fun …</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjggkunyz003t3k62m4d2gr08@published data-word-count=6><strong>But it’s nice to have it.&nbsp;</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjggl2ymd00gk3k62zc10z1m6@published data-word-count=51>I’ve talked to Pete Holmes about that. To have the audience laughing at a premise, and laughing at a premise, and you know what you have in your back pocket, it’s like you’re asking them to lean their chins further and further in, and then you knock them out like that.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjggkuo2h003u3k62b4pt3svf@published data-word-count=43><strong>At the end of the special, you thank Mike Birbiglia. You say he taught you how to be a comedian. I know you opened for him when you were younger, but that’s much more specific of a compliment. What did he teach you?&nbsp;</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjggl31d600gp3k628tp2zmnx@published data-word-count=259>I was a comedian trying to get on [the weekly comedy show] Invite Them Up With Eugene Mirman. New York had certain really cool alternative venues, but if you were just waiting for those venues, you weren’t getting up onstage. Birbiglia had his mother’s car and was driving to the Stress Factory in New Jersey, to clubs in Massachusetts, Ohio, wherever. He was getting booked as an emcee — emceeing at Crackers in Indianapolis. He was just like, “You have to go out and do this everywhere.” And he took me on the road for his Comedy Central college tour, but also for like two years. And that was insanely generous of him. I was a comedian with like five minutes of material, but we were friends. It was, “You have to go out, and you can’t be precious. You just graduated from college, so you probably think you’re intelligent, but you need to do shows.” He helped me get over the hump of, “I want to be a comedian, but I’m afraid to do shows.” As in, “I want to have been a comedian.” And after doing shows with him, I couldn’t wait to do the next show. Also, he was starting to do longer and longer stories onstage, and that influenced me a lot. His album&nbsp;<a href=#>Two-Drink Mike</a>&nbsp;is like one of the best albums of jokes ever, and then he followed it up with two amazing one-person shows. I learned from him about crafting stories, and how it’s a story, but it’s also about 600 jokes as well.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjggkuo2n003v3k62binj3h45@published data-word-count=12><strong>Are there parts of your comedy that you wish were more in&nbsp;Mulaney?&nbsp;</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjggl353500gu3k62lkpab6wi@published data-word-count=71>Sure. There are other aspects, but no show is as good as a vehicle for your stand-up unless it’s a show where you get to do a ton of stand-up. Stand-up is so free. You can be super nice and considerate. You can be an asshole. It’s always within the same joke. You can be super dark, but super enthusiastic about it. It’s a very weird thing you get to do.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjggkuo3a003w3k62qd4wya9v@published data-word-count=83><strong>A while back, we had&nbsp;</strong><a href=#><strong>Sarah Silverman interview Whitney Cummings</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;for us.

And feeding that through other things that maybe help people learn who you are is great. I like making television as well. But it would all be to drive standing onstage in theaters doing stand-up. That’s the constant. I don’t think I realized how much certain types of television shows take you away from that. We went on sale yesterday for the “Oh, Hello” show. It’s been selling huge. The Netflix special is coming out. This quality of life is excellent. Doing stand-up to a theater of people is an excellent way to make a living.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjggntr8v00133k62llw1ccnm@published data-word-count=15>Styling By: Lydia F Sellers for Exclusive Artists Management using Laura Mercier and Kevin Murphy</p><span role=tooltip id=annotation-1 data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/annotation/instances/cjgglrvec00k33k62dzocizos@published class=annotation data-editable=text>Seinfeld’s 2002 documentary about returning to stand-up after</span> <span role=tooltip id=annotation-2 data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/annotation/instances/cjgglsh7r00ne3k62e1th5ekt@published class=annotation data-editable=text>Seinfeld’s HBO stand-up special.
