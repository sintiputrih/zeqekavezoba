She shared the only part of that dark period in her life she looks back on with fond memories was her single "Cool For the Summer," which was her first foray into queer life. She told The Times she came out as queer to her stepdad in 2015 but couldn't manage to come out to her mom until two years later, when she went on her first date with a woman.</p><p dir=ltr>"I put a lot of negative expectations on that conversation that I wish I hadn't," Lovato said, via The New York Times. "Growing up in the South, growing up as Christian, I was scared to know how she'd react."</p><p dir=ltr>Fortunately, her mother reacted positively, telling her daughter she just wanted her to be happy, and Lovato embraced some of the more queer aspects of her life as time went on. Unfortunately, however, her struggles were far from over.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbG5gaX5ze9OhnGacopa6osDInGStqpGjwKe70aaYraGfo3qwsoydnKahXaG8t63TqGSfqp%2Biend506hka3BdrrKivtJmpqWcXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogInfo - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
