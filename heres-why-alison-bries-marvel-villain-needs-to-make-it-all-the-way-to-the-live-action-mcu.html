The new animated series, which is airing on both Disney Channel and Disney Plus, opened to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a perfect 100 score on Rotten Tomatoes</a> (while Quantumania is simply Rotten) and is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">adorned with an A-list voice cast</a> that most MCU movies would dream about. Among them is actress of the moment <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Alison Brie</a></strong>, whose appearance could allow the star to achieve her live-action ambitions.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=522 data-current-count=522 data-injectable=true>Brie features in Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur‘s double-sized opening episode as villain-of-the-week Aftershock. Despite the family-friendly and frenetic nature of the series — this is the show that has Laurence Fishburne playing <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a hilariously flamboyant take on The Beyonder</a>, after all — Brie actually lends the electric-themed antagonist more than a dash of sinister appeal. If she can bring that to the table with her vocal performance, clearly Brie would kill it as Aftershock in a live-action MCU role, too.</p><p data-characters=474 data-current-count=474 data-injectable=true>We’ve discussed before how MGADD is primed for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a full-on crossover with Marvel Studios’ franchise</a>, thanks to both its precocious protagonist’s predilection for producing portals and the Multiversal explosion that will occur in Avengers: Secret Wars. Brie is certainly at the top of the list of things from the show that should be carried over into the MCU. At the very least, it would make good on talk of Brie boarding the universe that dates back years.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/aftershock-moon-girl-and-devil-dinosaur-1.jpg><p data-characters=513 data-current-count=813 data-injectable=true>Prior to Tatiana Maslany’s casting, Brie was widely expected to be our She-Hulk, with the actress even being <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">quizzed on the possibility on talk shows</a>. Who knows if Brie was really up for that part, but afterward she admitted that she’d rather play a Marvel villain, as she <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">demanded the fans start a campaign to make the studio pay attention</a>. It’s possible this plea actually worked and led to her Moon Girl casting. Now we need this to be taken to the next level. Are you listening, Kevin Feige?</p><p data-characters=425 data-current-count=425 data-injectable=false>Thanks to the success of her new Amazon Prime rom-com, Somebody That I Used to Know — yes, the one in which <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">she indulges her inner nudist</a> with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">some shockingly gratuitous nudity</a> — Brie’s star is only on the rise, making her the perfect new addition to the ever-growing MCU. Honestly, if Aftershock doesn’t lead to a major Marvel future for Brie after Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur we will be a little surprised.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3ypsdGeqmavmK56orjIrKanZZKntqa%2FjKaYq66VoXq3tculmKKmXaOyprDSZquoZZ2WuKZ5yK1kmqScYsGpsYywmLJlpKR6tbTEZqOirpVirqTAyKilZqWTqnw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogInfo - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
