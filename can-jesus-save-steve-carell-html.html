Universal has been praying that it won’t flop — and aggressively marketing the biblically inflected comedy to Christian groups. They’ve partnered with co-producers Grace Hill Media to create <a href=#>ARKAlmighty</a>, an online faith-based volunteer outreach community, and organized Christian <a href=#>rock and gospel concerts</a> and <a href=#>radio broadcasts</a> to promote the film. Even Pat Robertson’s Hollywood-bashing 700 Club has a special online section devoted to the film, <a href=#>“Evan Almighty: The Biblical Facts Behind Noah’s Ark.”</a> (It also helps that director Tom Shadyac has been vocal about his recent <a href=#>conversion to Christianity</a>.) Of course, Hollywood has been finding God ever since The Passion of the Christ. The real question: Will God save Produce Pete?

This movie has grown from the Christian overtones of Bruce Almighty to a character who becomes outright religious and reads Bible passages out loud … The movie is delight and will have you laughing about scenes that passed several minutes ago.
