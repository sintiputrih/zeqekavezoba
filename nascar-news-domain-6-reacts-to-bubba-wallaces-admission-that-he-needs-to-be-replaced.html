The No:23 driver had a solid start to 2023 and followed an average performance in Daytona 500 and Fontana cup races, Wallace scored back-to-back top 5s and was ready for another solid day at Phoenix. But little did the 29 years old know that he was in for a disappointing ride.</p><p>He finished P14 at Phoenix while his teammate and COTA Cup race winner <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Tyler Reddick</a></strong> scored a podium. Going into the Atlanta Cup race, Wallace was in his element, as he is known for his superspeedway skills. But once again, it was a disappointment, and he was credited a P27. His strong start at COTA and the speed of Reddick in qualifying practice hinted at a potential return of Wallace. Still, a few bad decisions and the mechanical issue ended his day early.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>Bubba Wallace was so disappointed about his DNF, he called himself out straight after being released from the infield care center. He told Fox, “Just trying my hardest not to go down this slippery slope of self-doubt right here. Two weeks in a row of making rookie mistakes six years into Cup? Need to be replaced,”.</p><p>Wallace has always been critical of his performance and has never been shy about opening up. But occasionally, he goes too hard on himself while discussing losses. After all, it was not all because of him that the No:23 Toyota Camry retired early at COTA. He should take the poor runs as a motivation to leap forward again and silence his critics.</p><p>Discover: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“We got unlucky,” Kimi Raikkonen distraught after ending his NASCAR COTA outing in a disappointing P29</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/firstsportz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Hamlin-Wallace-and-Jordan-1024x768.jpg><p>The reaction from fans was mixed. Some were quick to sympathize with the driver and asked him to keep his chin up and bounce back. While the other half took the opportunity to troll his performance.
