This was mainly because he promised his mother to complete his university studies.</span></p><p><span>It is very interesting to note that he started his career with the Arizona Cardinals.&nbsp;Throughout his career, he has achieved 11 Pro Bowls and was a first-team All-Pro once, a second-team All-Pro twice, among many other accomplishments he has recorded.&nbsp;These include Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year in 2016.</span></p><h2><strong><span>family, mom</span></strong></h2><p><span>As stated earlier, the NFL star was raised in a family that loved sports.&nbsp;His father Larry Fitzgerald Sr. has been a sports journalist for a very long time.&nbsp;He has worked with a variety of media including television, radio, internet and, most famously, the newspaper.&nbsp;He covered over 30 Super Bowls.&nbsp;When he was much younger in high school, the senior Fitzgerald also played football despite not turning pro.</span></p><p><span>Larry Fitzgerald Jr. has a younger brother, Marcus Fitzgerald who also plays football.&nbsp;According to him, the two brothers learned the mental part of the game from their father.&nbsp;That was as far back as when Larry was only 10 years old.</span></p><p><span>He was very close to his mother Carol Fitzgerald until her death in 2003. He lost her to a brain hemorrhage which was caused after being treated for breast cancer.&nbsp;At the time of her death, Fitzgerald was in college, and by the time he came with her brother to see her, she was already in a coma.&nbsp;It is in his memory that the NFL star now leaves his hair the way he does because she also wore dead ends.&nbsp;More so, he always carries his driver’s license with him.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Wife, children and girlfriend</span></strong></h2><p><span>In case you were wondering, Larry Fitzgerald has no wife and he’s never been married.&nbsp;However, he was known to have had a few girlfriends in the past, the first being Angela Nazario.&nbsp;The two dated back in 2006. At the time, he was just 22 while the cheerleader was 35. Although the relationship didn’t last long, it did produce a son, Devine Fitzgerald.</span></p><p><span>Angela Nazario and Larry were then caught up in a legal battle in which the former cheerleader accused him of domestic abuse.&nbsp;She was able to get protection from him.</span></p><p><span>Larry has also been in quite a long relationship with Melissa Blakesley who is the mother of his second child, Apollo Fitzgerald.&nbsp;The two have supported each other for quite some time now and many already consider her his wife.&nbsp;The footballer is very close to his two children.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Body measurements</span></strong></h2><p><span>The Cardinals Wide dreadlock receiver has a good build that helped him play successfully in the NFL for over 14 years.&nbsp;He has a height of 1.91 m (6 ft 3 in) and a body weight of 99 kg (218 lb).&nbsp;That said, his general body measurements are not provided.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGikkae%2FunnFoquzn5Wnrq2wjLCgn51doryuecqim6xll56%2FrbLRopynnF2brq61y7Jkm6eUrnquscCsrKudnZq7tb%2BO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogInfo - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
