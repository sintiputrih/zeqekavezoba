Brown</a> received his first <a href=# id=auto-tag_oscar-nomination_1 data-tag=oscar-nomination>Oscar nomination</a> yesterday! The This Is Us star was nominated for Best Actor in a Supporting Role for his performance as Clifford Ellison in American Fiction, and most people were thrilled for the storied actor.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">He jumped on Instagram to share his gratitude as well as his 12-year-old son Andrew’s reaction to the nomination. To get the full effect of Andrew’s reaction, Brown took followers back to when he was nominated for a SAG Award earlier this month. <a tabindex=0 href=# class=lrv-u-flex@tablet><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-2026343563-1.jpg alt="Bianca Censori" height width style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="c-span u-letter-spacing-015 lrv-u-text-transform-uppercase a-font-secondary-bold-s lrv-u-font-size-14 lrv-u-margin-t-050 lrv-u-margin-t-1@desktop lrv-u-margin-b-025 u-margin-tb-00@tablet lrv-u-display-block">Related story</span> <span class="c-title a-font-secondary-medium-s@mobile-max a-font-primary-xs@tablet lrv-u-line-height-normal lrv-u-color-black lrv-u-margin-b-1 u-margin-t-050@tablet lrv-u-padding-b-025 lrv-u-color-brand-primary:hover">Bianca Censori’s Latest Skimpy Look in Public Must Have Stepdaughter North West Super Embarrassed or Super Empowered</span></a></p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“I show him everybody who got nominated for a SAG Award,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Brown said</a>. “And he goes, ‘Is this an Oscar?’ I said, ‘No, it’s the SAG Awards.’ He’s like, ‘Well, why are you coming to me with the SAG Awards?'”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Can you believe it?! The <a href=# id=auto-tag_tween-1_1 data-tag=tween-1>tween</a> was totally unimpressed with the major accomplishment.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“I’m like, ‘Bro, don’t disrespect SAG Awards.’ He’s like, ‘Until you get an Oscar, just keep it down.'”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Well, Andrew, yesterday was your (and your dad’s) lucky day! Because SKB did indeed get that Oscar nomination you were gunning for.</p><a tabindex=0 href=# class=lrv-u-flex@tablet><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-2026343563-1.jpg alt="Bianca Censori" height width style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="c-span u-letter-spacing-015 lrv-u-text-transform-uppercase a-font-secondary-bold-s lrv-u-font-size-14 lrv-u-margin-t-050 lrv-u-margin-t-1@desktop lrv-u-margin-b-025 u-margin-tb-00@tablet lrv-u-display-block">Related story</span> <span class="c-title a-font-secondary-medium-s@mobile-max a-font-primary-xs@tablet lrv-u-line-height-normal lrv-u-color-black lrv-u-margin-b-1 u-margin-t-050@tablet lrv-u-padding-b-025 lrv-u-color-brand-primary:hover">Bianca Censori’s Latest Skimpy Look in Public Must Have Stepdaughter North West Super Embarrassed or Super Empowered</span></a><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“So then I was showing them who got nominated this morning, and you could see his little 12-year-old mind trying to come up with a way to bring your boy down.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Hah! Of course he was! Because a tween can never admit if their parent is cool or impressive. That would be blasphemy.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“And then all he said was just congratulations,” Brown said with a huge smile on his face. Every parent of a t(w)een knows how big of a win it is to get positive reinforcement from their kid. Especially a kid who is realizing just how wrongly sassy they had been. Some might argue it’s a bigger accomplishment than the nomination itself. Sorry to The Academy, but Andrew might have you beat!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-2026343563-1.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Brown also told followers about how unbelievably unassuming his morning was. While most people in Hollywood were probably sitting by the phone with bated breath, Brown said he woke up on his kid’s floor. Uh…? We might have heard more about that, but the actor got distracted by his wife Ryan Michelle Bathe — with whom he also shares son Amaré, 8 — walking by.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“My phone was close to dead,” he said. “So I got up off the kid’s floor and I go to sleep and in my bedroom and my phone had died. So then I go back to the kid’s room, I pick up the phone, I put it on the charger, phone chargers, I’m getting breakfast ready for the kids to take them to school.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">As if Jan. 23 is just a regular ol’ day and not a career-defining one.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“But then I go back to grab my phone and a brother has like 126 messages,” he said. “And, ‘Oh my gosh. How come I got so many damn messages on my phone?'”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Well, you know the rest. Even more congratulatory messages — especially from the cast of This Is Us —flooded Brown’s Instagram comments.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“No one more deserving SKB,” Mandy Moore said.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Yes SKKKK!!! Im one of those 120 mesgs lol,” Susan Kelechi Watson commented.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“SKB! Win em all! Congratulations buddy!” Chris Sullivan wrote.</p><p><strong>These celebrity kids are giving their parents a humbling reality check by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">having zero interest in their movies</a>.</strong><br><a href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/kid-not-interested-in-famous-parents-careers.jpg alt width=1024 height=768 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tLTEpKWor6NjsLC5jqmYq52eqbavs46aqa2hk6GytHuRcmtrbGllfLit05yfZqukmr%2Bttc2gZKRlkqe8uLqMqKqcmaJiu7C5yKeYraGfo3q0u81mqZ6Zk6m2sLqO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogInfo - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
