The piece, to which they’ve attached words like “invasive, untrue, and inappropriate” and described as indicative of “a Taylor-shaped hole in people’s ethics,” was written by Anna Marks, who is no doubt having a stellar time on social media right now. It’s complicated, but the basics go like this:&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-what-is-the-taylor-swift-new-york-times-op-ed-controversy data-injectable=false>What is the Taylor Swift-New York Times op-ed controversy?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Taylor Swift (@taylorswift)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=267 data-current-count=567 data-injectable=true>Marks, as relayed in her <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">op-ed</a>, “Look What We Made Taylor Swift Do,” has theories about Taylor Swift’s sexuality. Taylor Swift, by way of her representation, would very much prefer it if Marks found a place to express said theories besides The New York Times.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=633 data-current-count=633 data-injectable=true>Calling the piece “speculative” is generous. Echoing many Taylor Swift fans on the internet, Marks follows a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Pepe Silvia-style red yarn conspiracy trail</a> of supposed LGBTQIA+ breadcrumbs, purportedly dropped by the most popular musician on the planet. She points to Swift’s hair color in music videos, her past statements about the frequently homophobic nature of the country music industry, and a litany of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Oliver Stone-worthy</a>, circumstantial clues that Swift is secretly a member of the queer community, desperately searching for a way to come out, trapped in a tower of her own success like a world-famous bisexual Rapunzel.</p><p data-characters=200 data-current-count=200 data-injectable=false>“This article wouldn’t have been allowed to be written about Shawn Mendes or any male artist whose sexuality has been questioned by fans,” Swift’s reps said of the piece in a statement to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">CNN</a>.</p><p data-characters=414 data-current-count=614 data-injectable=true>Swift, for her part, has been fairly vocal about her support for the LGBTQIA+ world, and the fact that she’s not personally a member. In 2019, she briefly described to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Vogue</a> the complexities of being an “advocate for a community that I’m not a part of.” This and other interviews, along with her high-profile relationships, have done little to dissuade parties convinced of her “secret” life.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=491 data-current-count=491 data-injectable=false>Marks’ piece distinguishes itself from previous speculation on the topic of Swift’s sexuality almost entirely in scale. It also adds itself to a list of frequently attention-grabbing op-eds in The New York Times that have been widely viewed as at best sensationalist and at worst irresponsible, with a 2023 opinion piece titled “In Defense of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">J.K. Rowling</a>” (which inspired around 200 of the paper’s contributors to denounce its editorial practices) probably being the best example.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqcWMoqpmrJGuubC%2BjKyuop6kqHq1scCmZK6oo5rBbsPIrZ9mpqliwaq5xKyqZqegYrKlecCbpq6sXam1pnnSoqWgnaJiwamxjJymp6yipMOmvtKyZJ6woKGuqrrEnWY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogInfo - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
