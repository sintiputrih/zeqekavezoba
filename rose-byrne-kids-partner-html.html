So my “husband” will be like, “I’ve been waiting for 25 minutes.”</p><p>The actress and Cannavale actually refer to each other as husband and wife even though they are not <a href=# rel=follow>married</a>, and they’ve discussed their aversion for labels in the past. <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span></p><h2>Husband and Wife</h2><p>During a joint interview in January 2020 with Vulture, the couple <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">opened</a> up about&nbsp;their decision to call each other husband and wife. The actress started off by revealing that they were planning to get married, but then they had a child.&nbsp;</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Her "husband" then explained that calling each other boyfriend and girlfriend felt too young, and the word partner felt clinical. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In another interview with Evening Standard, Byrne <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">revealed</a> that it was easier to call each other husband and wife.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>He’s practically my husband, so calling&nbsp;him that is easier. The formality isn’t a draw for me, but we’ll do it one day.&nbsp;</p><p>The two first met in 2012 on the set of&nbsp;Annie, the modern reboot of the original Broadway musical that opened at the Alvin Theatre and began dating shortly after.&nbsp;</p><p>However, even though Vanity Fair <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">confirmed</a> that the couple was not married in December 2019, Byrne<strong>&nbsp;</strong>reignited engagement rumors after she was spotted wearing a diamond ring on her wedding finger.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2>Career and Kids</h2><p>In the 9 years, they have been together, Byrne and Cannavale have shared the screen a handful of times.</p><p>They appeared together in&nbsp;Spy,&nbsp;Martha the Monster,&nbsp;Angie Tribeca, and&nbsp;Adult Beginners. They were also cast for a live reading of Arthur Miller’s&nbsp;A View from the Bridge.&nbsp;</p><p>The spark that the actors’ symbiotically complementary looks bring to the screen&nbsp;has made them a powerful celebrity couple and aroused curiosity from fans even when their relationship was&nbsp;shrouded in mystery.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>They refrain from talking&nbsp;about their love life, but the couple <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">talked</a>&nbsp;about their kids in&nbsp;The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.&nbsp;They&nbsp;revealed they heard their boys conspiring against them. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The couple’s first son, Rocco Robin Cannavale, was born in February&nbsp;2016, and their second son, Rafa, was born in November 2017.</p><p>Cannavale has another son, Jake, whom he had with the writer Jenny Lumet in 1995. Jake is also an actor and appeared alongside his father in&nbsp;Nurse Jackie&nbsp;and played a bounty hunter in the&nbsp;Star Wars&nbsp;show,&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>The Mandalorian</a>.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>The couple is currently&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">working</a>&nbsp;on Byrne’s first production from her Dollhouse Pictures,&nbsp;Seriously Red,&nbsp;which will release in October.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGipnqSRqbawutKhoKlnoqTApnnBsqmnnV2gtqW%2FjKmYq6yemr9vtNOmow%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogInfo - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
