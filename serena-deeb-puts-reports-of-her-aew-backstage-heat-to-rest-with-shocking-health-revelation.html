She continued to be a regular presence on AEW television until she participated in the AEW Dark: Elevation taping on October 18th, 2022.</p><p>Serena Deeb recently returned to AEW events and took to Instagram to disclose that she had experienced three seizures since last October, which had kept her out of the wrestling ring. Her absence had nothing to do with backstage heat whatsoever.</p><p>“Since last October, I’ve had a series of three unprovoked seizures. This has been a really dramatic time period for me and has affected my career and life. In a lot of ways, it’s been really scary for me. I’ve seen a lot of different doctors and had every test imaginable. For the longest time, nobody could tell me why this happened.”</p><p>Serena Deeb discussed the difficulties of being away from the wrestling ring, expressing her deep love for the industry and her longing to perform once again. She extended her understanding and support to individuals who have experienced seizures and aimed to convey a message of solidarity to those dealing with similar challenges, reassuring them that they are not alone and that there is hope on the horizon.</p><p>Serena Deeb further stated, “I had a recent consultation with my neurologist, and he confirmed that I have fully recovered, I am in good health, and I have received official clearance to resume wrestling. This means I am prepared for my return.”</p><p>It’s nice to have Serena Deeb back on AEW television. Hopefully, Tony Khan can find a use for her, because he has a lot of matches to book in AEW and ROH.</p><p>For more on this story, and so many more, please keep it tuned with us here at Ringside News.
