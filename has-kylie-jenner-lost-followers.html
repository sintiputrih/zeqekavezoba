But, has she lost followers?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Social media users are still saddened about the events that took place at <a href=#>Travis Scott</a>'s annual <a href=#>Astroworld Festival</a> in Texas on Nov. 5, 2021. No one would have thought that the night would have ended in eight deaths and hundreds of injuries, but it's reality.</p><p>Travis’s beau, <a href=#>Kylie Jenner</a>, has been vocal on social media about sharing her condolences to families who lost loved ones and to people injured or affected in any way. While her statement was expected, fans are not too fond of what she had to say. So, did Kylie Jenner lose followers on social media? Here’s everything that we know.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">It appears that Kylie Jenner has not lost fans on social media, but users say otherwise.</h2><p>In case you've been out of the loop, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kylie Jenner is one of the most followed celebrities</a> on social media. On Instagram, the beauty boss has garnered 280 million followers, along with 39.3 million on Twitter.</p><p>And while it seems as if her numbers have not budged since the Astroworld tragedy, fans have said otherwise.</p><p>Twitter user <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@Onyeaka shared</a>: “I’m convinced that Travis and Kylie Jenner followers are fake. Thousands of people unfollowed them and the numbers haven’t budged.

Scrolling through social media tells a completely different story about Kylie’s fanbase. Many people have slammed the star for not only staying quiet for so long after the tragedy, but for saying that she and Travis were unaware of the events that took place.</p><p>“Travis and I are broken and devastated,” Kylie wrote in a statement posted to her Instagram stories (per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">KHOU 11</a>) on Nov. 7. “My thoughts and prayers are with all who lost their lives, were injured or affected in anyway by yesterday’s events. And also for Travis who I know cares deeply for his fans and the Houston community."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>People deleting their Travis Scott music and blocking him on Spotify and throwing out their Kylie Jenner make up 💀 <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/xjL2DHIHVv</a></p>— Danielle 🌹💉💉 (@_d_rose_xo) <a href=#>November 9, 2021</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Kylie Jenner saying thoughts and prayers about the incident frustrates the hell out of me</p>— 🦐 ALEX 🦐 (@bigteesmallgirl) <a href=#>November 7, 2021</a> <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>She continued, "I want to make it clear we weren’t aware of any fatalities until the news came out after the show and in no world would we have continued filming or performing. I am sending my deepest condolences to all the families during this difficult time and will be praying for the healing of everyone affected.”</p><p>Fans believe that Kylie had to have some knowledge about the severity of the situation, since her now-deleted Instagram stories showed <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">videos and pictures from the festival</a> with ambulance vehicles in sight.</p><p>With many Kylie Cosmetics fans calling for people to stop supporting the brand, you would expect for her follower counts to take a dip, but they’re still at a major high.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Kylie Jenner has lost followers in the past due to an Instagram glitch.</h2><p>In February 2019, Kylie was one of a few celebs and influencers including Ariana Grande who saw a drastic drop in their follower counts, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Elle</a> magazine.</p><p>Kylie, who had reportedly accumulated 126 million followers on Instagram at the time, dropped to 124 million.
