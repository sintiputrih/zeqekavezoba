The most successful album of the artist made him <strong>$25 million.</strong></p><p>Likewise, his 1985 album Around the World in a Day made<strong> $7 million</strong>, his 1986 album Parade made <strong>$2 million</strong>, his 1989 album made <strong>$11 million</strong>, and the compilation album The Very Best of Prince made <strong>$3.455 million</strong> for the singer.</p><p>In 2004 alone, Prince made <strong>$56.5 million</strong> from concerts and album and publishing sales.</p><p>Prince’s performance in 2008 Coachella earned him a paycheck of <strong>$5 million.</strong></p><h4>Tour Income</h4><p>One of the greatest musicians was also one of the biggest concerts draws.</p><p>Prince had headlined several highest-grossing tours over the course of his career.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/PrinceLive-876x1024.jpg><p>While the exact data of how many tours Prince had headlined is not available, sources claim that he did 30 identifiable tours over his 40 years career.</p><p>Out of that, his 2004 tour grossed over <strong>$87 million</strong> at the box office, making it the most successful tour of the year.</p><h3>Will and Settlements</h3><p>The estate settlement is perhaps the most hectic for the people involved in the procedure, especially when there is no proper will which is exactly what happened after Prince’s death.</p><p>The most important asset for musicians like Prince has to be their music rights and catalog, as it acts as a perpetual source of income via royalties.</p><p>In Prince’s case, the singer famously owned most of his work.</p><p>When he made his demise, there was no proper will; thus, the value of his entire estate was passed to six family members.</p><p>After Prince’s death, there was hysterical debate over his estate, which seemed pretty obvious as the case was hundreds of millions of dollars.</p><p>The administrator of the estate was Comerica Bank & Trust.</p><p>According to their estimation, Prince’s estate was worth around <strong>$82 million</strong> in total. This included all his real estate, name, likeness, and, most importantly, music rights.</p><p>However, contrasting the evaluation of CBT, Internal Revenue Service claimed that the estate was worth at least <strong>$163 million.</strong></p><p>After a few trials and legal disputes, Comerica and IRS came to a common ground and valued Prince’s estate at <strong>$156 million</strong> in total.</p><p>With all said and done, the estate was evenly divided between three of his oldest family heirs and his music company Primary Wave.</p><p>Nevertheless, over the six-year period between Prince’s death and the final agreement, two of his six siblings died.</p><p>Interesting!</p><h3>Disputed value of Prince’s Estate</h3><p>After Prince’s death, the dispute between estate administrator Comerica Bank & Trust and IRS rose, with both claiming the different value of the estate.</p><p>The first and foremost dispute was over New Power Generation publishing. New Power Generation NPG was the backing band of Prince from 1990 to 2013.</p><p>Just so you know, NPG owns the Prince’s songwriting copyrights.</p><p>Over the NPG publishing, Comerica fixed the value of <strong>$21 million</strong> while IRS pegged <strong>$37 million.</strong></p><p>Similarly, another dispute was over NPG Records, Prince’s record label.</p><p>Over this matter, Comerica pegged a <strong>$19.4 million</strong> valuation while the IRS pegged<strong> $46 million.</strong></p><p>Likewise, Comerica valued “Writer’s Share” of the songwriting catalog a mere <strong>$11 million,</strong> while IRS fixed the value of a staggering<strong> $22 million.</strong></p><h2>Net Worth of Prince in Different Currencies</h2><p>Prince’s net worth was $200 million at his death. Let’s check it out in the different currencies:</p><table width=680><tbody><tr><td><strong>Currency</strong></td><td><strong>Net Worth</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Euro</strong></td><td>€ 189.77 Million</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Pound Sterling</strong></td><td>£ 160.27 Million</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Australian Dollar</strong></td><td>A$ 285.13 Million</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Canadian Dollar</strong></td><td>C$ 256.59 Million</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Indian Rupee</strong></td><td>₹ 15,499,800,000</td></tr><tr><td><strong>BitCoin</strong></td><td>฿ 6,657.79</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Prince | Houses & Cars</h2><h3>Houses</h3><p>Prince’s net worth at the time of his death was <strong>$200 million.</strong></p><p>He had invested his fortune in several pieces of real estate across the country.</p><p>He had 149 acres of land in Chanhassen, Minnesota.
