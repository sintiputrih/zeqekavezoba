Her elegant gown featured a high neckline and long sleeves. Grainge, for his part, wore a dark suit and matching tie that had subtle dots throughout.</p><p>Ahead of their wedding, <a href=#>Richie converted to Judaism</a>. The California native confirmed the news via her Instagram Story on April 3, describing the moment as “a magical day.”</p><p>The couple have known each other for years but <a href=#>began sparking romance rumors</a> in January 2021. Richie <a href=#>first confirmed her relationship</a> with Grainge that March. Elliot is the son of <strong>Sir Lucian Grainge</strong>, who is a frequent collaborator of Sofia’s father, <a href=#><strong>Lionel Richie</strong></a>.</p><p>Prior to her romance with Elliot, the California native dated <a href=#><strong>Scott Disick</strong></a> for three years from 2017 to 2020 – a romance that her dad <a href=#>didn’t exactly seem to approve of</a>. Her father joked to <a href=#>Us Weekly</a> in October 2017 that he was “scared to death” of the Keeping Up with the Kardashians star <a href=#>dating his daughter</a>.</p><p>Years later, Lionel, 73, revealed that he doesn’t have to worry about his youngest daughter’s now-husband. He told <a href=#>Access Hollywood</a> in April he “[loves] Elliot.” He explained, “I’ve known him since he was 12. It was one of those things where I don’t have to go back and check out the kid. I know who it is.”</p><p>The American Idol judge isn’t the only one who has <a href=#>expressed their approval of the newlyweds</a>. Lionel’s eldest daughter,<a href=#> <strong>Nicole Richie​​</strong></a>, also gushed about her brother-in-law. Commenting on <a href=# rel>Sofia’s post for Elliot’s 28th birthday</a> last November, she remarked, “Elliot i love you more than you love instacart.”</p><p>The power duo’s romantic <a href=#>engagement in April 2022</a> was shortly followed by <a href=#>an extravagant engagement party</a> that May. The floral-themed event was <a href=#>attended by the model’s family</a> and featured a floral cake, Elliot and Sofia-themed cocktails and an al fresco dining table.</p><p>A source told <a href=#>Us</a> in August 2022 that Sofia hoped her wedding would be “just as elegant as her engagement party” and gave a hint that the big day would also be “floral-themed.”</p><p>Nicole also <a href=#>wanted to be a part of the planning</a>, the source confirmed. The House of Harlow designer “[saw the wedding] as a fun project to take on,” the insider told<a href=#> Us</a> at the time. Regardless of whether her artistic influence played <a href=#>a role in the event planning</a>, the Simple Life alum wanted “nothing less than to be by her sister’s side” at the wedding, the source elaborated.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>In October, Sofia, Nicole and several friends celebrated the impending nuptials on <a href=#>a bachelorette getaway to Paris</a>. The bride-to-be and her guests shared several scenes from her extravagant trip via Instagram: from caviar to macarons to posing in front of the Eiffel Tower, the glamorous adventure gave a sneak peek into the joyful fun that would come on wedding day.</p><p>Scroll down for a behind-the-scenes look at their wedding weekend:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkwLCyyJpkq6GTnbamecSlo6KnpGK0s63Ip56eq12ssqWwyKeeZq%2BVmrimusNmp6Kbo2Q%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogInfo - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
