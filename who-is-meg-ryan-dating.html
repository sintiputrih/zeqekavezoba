With the release of a trailer for her upcoming romantic comedy, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">What Happens Later</a>, Ryan simultaneously announced her glorious return to show business.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=286 data-current-count=286 data-injectable=false>Publicly retiring from acting after 2008’s The Women, following by a small role in 2015’s Ithaca, Meg Ryan decided to step away from the spotlight for an undisclosed amount of time — citing “burnout” as a main reason behind taking the break in the first place.</p><p data-characters=89 data-current-count=375 data-injectable=false>Now, Meg is back and better than ever in what seems to be a film only she could pull off.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=675 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=285 data-current-count=285 data-injectable=false>Another romantic comedy. Seriously, these things are Meg Ryan’s bread and butter. She’s the queen of rom-coms, and rightfully so. This is the same woman who has starred in films like: You’ve Got Mail, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">When Harry Met Sally</a>, and Sleepless in Seattle — to name a few.</p><p data-characters=243 data-current-count=528 data-injectable=true>Along the way Meg romanced plenty of Hollywood heavyweights during her time in front of the camera, and happened to fall in love off-screen in the process. So who were all of her romantic partners in the past, and who the heck is she with now?</p><h2 id=h-who-has-meg-ryan-dated data-injectable=false>Who has Meg Ryan dated?</h2><p data-characters=328 data-current-count=328 data-injectable=false>Dated, married, Meg’s done both. To start, Meg Ryan married actor <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Dennis Quaid</a> in 1991 — although they would separate 9 years later in 2000. After Quaid, Meg found love again with another star, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Russell Crowe</a>. And while filming 2000’s Proof of Life, the pair began a brief romantic relationship which ended in 2001.</p><p data-characters=383 data-current-count=711 data-injectable=true>Having enough of the actors in her life, Meg decided to take a stab at dating a musicians instead. You know, because they’re notoriously known for their stability and good behavior. Meg and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">John Mellencamp</a> got together in late 2010, and were together until 2014. Four years later they found each other again, and announced a short-lived engagement that was broken off in 2019.</p><p data-characters=314 data-current-count=314 data-injectable=false>Now, nearly four years since her failed engagement, Meg is back and better than ever. So who is she with? More importantly, does it matter? She’s had some ups, she’s had some downs — she’s dates some of the most recognizable men in entertainment. Single or not, Meg Ryan is going to be alright.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Who is Meg Ryan romantically with now?</h2><p data-characters=301 data-current-count=615 data-injectable=false>No one. As far as we can tell, Ryan isn’t dating anyone publicly, at least on paper. That doesn’t mean she hasn’t had some secrets flings since that final breakup — but why should anyone care about that? If the lady wants to keep her romantic life private, then more power to her.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsS0e9ahpmaho2K6prOMq7Capl2ZrrW1zaBm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogInfo - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
