So what people saw when I was going back and forth is that I still have to be able to throw my version of what people would throw into the curriculum,” he added.</p><p>The former couple have been candid about their ups and downs <a href=#>since Kardashian filed for divorce in February 2021</a>. The Yeezy designer <a href=#>later made headlines for his controversial public statements</a> about the KKW Beauty founder and her family.</p><p>In response, Kardashian <a href=#>called out her ex-husband’s “constant attacks”</a> about her parenting in a rare statement.</p><p>“As the parent who is the main provider and caregiver for our children, I am doing my best to protect our daughter while also allowing her to express her creativity in the medium that she wishes with adult supervision — because it brings her happiness,” she wrote via Instagram in February. “Divorce is difficult enough on our children and Kanye’s obsession with trying to control and manipulate our situation so negatively and publicly is only causing further pain for all.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The California native continued: “I wish to handle all matters regarding our children privately and hopefully he can finally respond to the third attorney he has had in the last year to resolve any issues amicably.”</p><p>The businesswoman <a href=#>hinted at bigger issues in her marriage</a> during season 1 of Hulu’s <a href=#>The Kardashians</a>. “We always tiptoe around each other’s situations because we don’t want to meddle. And I respect that no one came to me during my marriage and was like, ‘Are you good?’ Everyone let me have my own journey and see that on my own,” Kim told her sister <a href=#><strong>Khloé Kardashian</strong></a> during an episode of the show in June. “I appreciate that but sometimes I look back and I am like, ‘When do we jump in?’ That is what I am so unclear about.”</p><p>At the time, a source exclusively told Us Weekly that <a href=#>there is “a lot more” to Kim’s relationship with West</a> that “people don’t know” about. “Things that happened behind closed stores and in private conversations,” the insider revealed. “Even some of her closest friends don’t know. Kim <a href=#>will share the truth and speak more</a> about her past once she’s ready.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGakmZ6usm7DxKyrZqOZonqsrdGdmKygmZa7br7Aoqqeq12kwrN5yqKbrGVoZXqxsdGcnKesXaSzbsDHnmStoZ2afA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogInfo - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
