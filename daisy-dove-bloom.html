Communities around the world are still experiencing a shortage of health-care workers and every 11 seconds a pregnant woman or newborn dies, mostly from preventable causes. Since COVID-19 many more newborn lives are at risk because of the increased lack of access to water, soap, vaccines, and medicines that prevent diseases. As parents to a newborn, this breaks our hearts, as we empathize with struggling parents now more than ever.”</p><p>They continued:</p><p>“We know UNICEF is there, on the ground, doing whatever it takes to make sure every expecting mother has access to a trained health worker and access to quality healthcare.”</p><p>Thus, In celebration of the heart, Katy Perry and Orlando Bloom have set up a donation page to celebrate DDB’s arrival.
