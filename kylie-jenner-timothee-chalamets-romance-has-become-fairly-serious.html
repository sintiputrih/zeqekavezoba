(Chalamet stars as Willy Wonka in the <a href=#>new movie musical</a>, which hits theaters on Friday, December 15.)</p><p>“Kylie really didn’t want to make a huge scene when she attended the Wonka premiere, so she decided to skip the carpet and make a low-key entrance,” the source told Us. “This night was all about Timothée and she didn’t want to take away from that in any way.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Kylie-Jenner-and-Timothee-Chalamet-Are-Fairly-Serious-and-Focus-on-Making-Time-to-See-Each-Other-066.jpg><p>The Wonka premiere is not the first time Kylie has subtly supported her boyfriend at one of his events. Last month, Kylie celebrated Chalamet’s Saturday Night Live hosting gig <a href=#>at the afterparty</a>. She arrived at the gathering in a <a href=#>black off-the-shoulder top</a> and black leggings, while Chalamet donned bright colors with his blue hoodie and purple jacket.</p><p>Chalamet, for his part, supported Kylie at the <a href=#>WSJ. Innovator Awards</a> earlier that month, where she was honored as the magazine’s 2023 Brand Innovator for her new clothing brand, <a href=#>Khy</a>. The pair walked the red carpet separately but were photographed sitting next to each other inside the event.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Kylie-Jenner-and-Timothee-Chalamet-Are-Fairly-Serious-and-Focus-on-Making-Time-to-See-Each-Other-067.jpg><p><a href=#>Us</a> confirmed the couple’s romance in April, nearly three months after Kylie <a href=#>called it quits</a> with her ex <strong>Travis Scott</strong>. “Kylie thinks Timothée is really sweet and she does see potential,” a second source shared at the time. “Kylie knows she and Travis will always be in each other’s lives, and they have an amazing coparenting relationship.” (Kylie and Scott, 32, share daughter Stormi, 5, and son Aire, 22 months.)</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The relationship has won the approval of Kylie’s famous family as another source told <a href=#>Us</a> in June that the Kardashian-Jenners “absolutely approve of them dating.” Kris 68, even hyped up Chalamet’s SNL gig last month by sharing a promo for the episode via her Instagram Story. “Tune in to SNL tonight!” she <a href=#>captioned the post</a>.</p><p>With reporting by Sarah Jones</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaksZyesm62xKelnqpdqbauu9OhnJ5lk52ura3MnqusZaKkuqK6wp5koZmjYq%2Bmr86mnGaekZ6%2FrcWMrJyroZ%2BqwHA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogInfo - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
