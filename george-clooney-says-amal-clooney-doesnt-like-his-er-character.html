George was a main cast member until 1999, <a href=#>when he left the show after five seasons</a>. Before the show’s 15th and final season wrapped, he returned to reprise his role 10 years after his exit.</p><p>In Monday’s interview, the Ocean’s 11 star detailed his transition from acting on TV to starring in films. He also explained why he has done more directing in recent years.</p><p>“When you’re doing television, you’re doing 22 hours a year … it’s, like, doing 11 movies,” he explained on the podcast. “You’re doing a lot of acting, and it’s fun to be involved. But, about 25 years ago, I just started looking at it [and] thinking, ‘I don’t want to worry about what some casting director thinks of how I’m aging.’”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/George-Clooneys-Wife-Amal-Clooney-Doesnt-Like-His-ER-Character.jpg><p>George also opened up about how enamored was with Amal when the pair first crossed paths, noting that <a href=#>she “took my breath away.”</a> The Oscar winner continued, “She was brilliant and funny and beautiful and kind. I was sort of swept off my feet. We got engaged after a few months and got married within the first year that we met. It surprised me more than probably anybody else in the world — and everybody else was pretty surprised.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>George and Amal <a href=#>tied the knot in 2014</a>. They went on to <a href=#>welcome their now-3-year-old twins, Alexander and Ella</a>, in 2017.</p><p>Earlier this year, the Descendants actor shared some insight into how the longtime couple and their little ones have been coping amid the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>“It’s been nine months mostly inside the house,” he said during <a href=#>a virtual Los Angeles Times roundtable</a> in January. “I have 3-year-old twins, so that’s been an adventure in a lot of washing dishes and changing diapers. My own, mostly.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJ6ep6Kcsm6vy6imp52pYsCixdJmmKaZnGKwrbvOp5yyZZSksrS602ajoqOVYrWqv4yeqWabmJa%2Foq%2FTnqlo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogInfo - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
