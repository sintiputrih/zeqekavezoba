To the public, Rick Harrison is perhaps best known as one of the main stars in the reality television series called “Pawn Stars”, which actually showcases his business – “World Famous Gold & Silver Pawn Shop” – and certainly gives it a boost.</span></p><p><span lang=en-us>So just how rich is Rick Harrison, as of early 2017? According to authoritative sources, Rick’s net worth is estimated to be over$10 million, most of which he has accumulated from his various business ventures, and to his on-screen appearances during the last several years.</span></p><h3>Rick Harrison Net Worth $10 Million</h3><p>Rick’s family moved to San Diego when he was two, and he later studied at Taft Middle School, but never matriculated, leaving at 14, and instead he started working for his father’s company called “Gold & Silver Pawn Shop”, which the family established when they moved again, this time to Las Vegas, Nevada, after their real estate business failed. Their business expanded, but this time slow and steadily with no failure, so the Harrison’s became well-known in the industry.</p><p>Rick Harrison had joined the company in the late ‘80s, and became inspired to create a show about their pawn shop from as early as 2003, when his own store was featured on the television series “Insomniac with <a href=#>Dave Attell</a>”. Even though Harrison’s project was initially shut down, it was later picked up by the History Channel, and with minor changes went to air in 2009.</p><p>The show primarily focuses on the business owned by the Harrison family, now called “World Famous Gold & Silver Pawn Shop”. Since its premiere, the show has managed to gather generally positive critical feedback, and despite minor criticisms has maintained high average audience ratings. During the first several seasons aired on screen, “Pawn Stars” became the highest-rated series on the History channel, averaging more than seven million viewers. Considered to be a mixture of “Antiques Roadshow” and “LA Ink”, “Pawn Stars” has won numerous awards, including Pawnbroker of the Year Award, and even had a day named “Pawn Stars Day” by the Clark County Commission. Aside from the main cast, such celebrities as <a href=#>Bob Dylan</a>, <a href=#>Steve Carell</a>, <a href=#>Katie Couric</a> and <a href=#>Jeremy McKinnon</a> have appeared in the show as guest stars. The series’ popularity has inspired the release of several spin-off series, the most notable being “Pawn Stars UK”, “American Restoration”, “Counting Cars” and “Cajun Pawn Stars”.</p><p>Aside from “Pawn Stars”, Rick Harrison has made appearances in other television projects. In 2012 he appeared alongside <a href=#>Miranda Cosgrove</a> and <a href=#>Jennette McCurdy</a> in the teen sitcom “iCarly”, and later that same year starred in an episode of the sitcom called “The Middle”, with <a href=#>Patricia Heaton</a>, <a href=#>Neil Flynn</a> and <a href=#>Eden Sher</a>.</p><p>In addition to his business ventures and acting career, Rick Harrison has become a published author, releasing a biographical book entitled “License to Pawn: Deals, Steals, and My Life at the Gold & Silver”, which was included in the New York Times list of best-sellers.</p><p>In his personal life, Rick Harrison has married three times, firstly to Kim from 1982 to ’85 with whom he has two sons, and then to Tracy from 1986 to 2011 with whom he has another son, He has been married to Deanna since 2013 – they continue to live in Las Vegas.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=27.721448467967><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Rick Harrison</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$10 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>March 22, 1965</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Lexington, North Carolina, United States</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Profession</td><td>Businessman, Reality television personality, Television Producer</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Education</td><td>Taft Middle School (San Diego Unified School District)</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Spouse</td><td>Deanna Burditt (m. 2013), Tracy Harrison (m. 1986–2011), Kim Harrison (m. 1982–1985)</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Children</td><td>Sarina Harrison, Corey Harrison, Adam Harrison, Jake Harrison</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Parents</td><td>JoAnne Rhue Harrison, Richard Benjamin Harrison</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Siblings</td><td>Joe Harrison, Chris Harrison, Sherry Harrison</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Nicknames</td><td>Richard (Rick) Kevin Harrison , Richard Kevin Harrison , The Spotter</td></tr><tr readability=0.37209302325581><td>Facebook</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.facebook.com/gspawnshop</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.34146341463415><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://twitter.com/goldsilverpawn</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.32727272727273><td>Instagram</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.instagram.com/rick_harrison/?hl=en</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.25806451612903><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>www.imdb.com/name/nm3623485</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.27586206896552><td>Allmusic</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>www.allmusic.com/artist/rick-harrison-mn0001900058</a></td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Awards</td><td>Pawnbroker of the Year Award (2010, National Pawnbrokers Association)</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Nominations</td><td>“Pawn Stars UK”, “American Restoration”, “Counting Cars” and “Cajun Pawn Stars” Read more: http://celebritynetworth.wiki/rick-harrison-net-worth/#ixzz4ipFI1gYq</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Movies</td><td>“The Middle: The Safe” (2012), “iCarly: iLost My Head in Vegas” (2012), “United Stuff of America” (2014)</td></tr><tr readability=11><td>TV Shows</td><td>“Antiques Roadshow”, “LA Ink”, “Pawn Stars”, “Pawn Stars UK”, “American Restoration”, “Counting Cars”, “Cajun Pawn Stars”, “Insomniac with Dave Attell” (2003),</td></tr></table><table class=trademarks><tr><th>#</th><th>Trademark</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Shaved head</td></tr></table><table class=interesting_facts readability=3.5><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr readability=3><td>1</td><td>Suffers from Epilepsy.
