Though Superman made his debut on the Girl of Steel’s show back in season 2, his nemesis has taken a while to get to National City, but that all changes in episode 4×15 “O Brother, Where Art Thou?” in which Jon Cryer joins the cast as the iconic bad bald billionaire.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=516 data-current-count=516 data-injectable=true>We previously got <a href=# rel=noopener>our first glimpse of the villain</a> a while back, which told us that Cryer’s Luthor would unusually sport a beard, but this new batch of photos show us that Lex also won’t be in the best of health when we catch up with him. The four snaps depict Lex and his sister Lena in the Luthor mansion, with the former wheelchair bound. It looks like he’s doing everything he can to heal himself, however, as he’s also shown studying a meteor rock and inspecting some disembodied hearts.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Supergirl-O-Brother-Where-Art-Thou-1.jpeg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Supergirl-O-Brother-Where-Art-Thou-2.jpeg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Supergirl-O-Brother-Where-Art-Thou-3.jpeg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Supergirl-O-Brother-Where-Art-Thou-4.jpeg><p data-characters=230 data-current-count=230 data-injectable=false>The synopsis for the episode tells us a little more about what we can expect from Lex’s grand entrance, too, and it seems that Lena will have to decide if she has any allegiance to her evil bro when he comes to her for help.</p><p>“JON CRYER GUEST STARS AS ICONIC DC COMICS’ VILLAIN LEX LUTHOR</p><p>“Secretly furloughed from prison due to failing health, Lex Luthor (guest star Jon Cryer) visits his sister, Lena (Katie McGrath), to seek her help finding a cure. Savvy as ever, Lena is suspicious of Lex’s motives but when she’s faced with a life and death situation, she must decide how she truly feels about her brother.</p><p>“Meanwhile, Supergirl (Melissa Benoist) and J’onn (David Harewood) face off against Manchester Black (guest star David Ajala). James’ sister Kelly (guest star Azie Tesfai) comes to town.”</p><p data-characters=328 data-current-count=558 data-injectable=true>DC comics fans may recall the time when Lex fell gravely ill after prolonged exposure to Kryptonite gave him cancer. It’s possible the show’s drawing from this storyline, which no doubt means that Lex will have an even stronger hatred for the House of El if their planet is to blame for his illness.
