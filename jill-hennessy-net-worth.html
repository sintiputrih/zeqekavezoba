Jill is a musician and actress, best known for being part of the television series “Law & Order” as prosecutor Claire Kincaid. She was also the lead another TV series “Crossing Jordan”, and all of her efforts have helped put her net worth to where it is today.</p><p>How rich is Jill Hennessy? As of late-2016, sources inform us of a net worth that is at $12 million, mostly earned through her numerous acting endeavors. She has also appeared in several films, including “Robocop 3” and “Most Wanted”. She has also done independent film work, and as she continues her career it is expected that her wealth will increase.</p><h3>Jill Hennessy Net Worth $12 million</h3><p>At a young age, Jill’s family moved around a lot because of the demands of her father’s work in sales. She attended Stanley Park Senior Public School and after matriculating went to Grand River Collegiate Institute. To earn extra money she would often busk in the Toronto subway.</p><p>Jill made her debut alongside her twin sister in the 1988 film “Dead Ringers”, in which they played twin call girls. She was short listed for “The X-Files” in the role of Dana Scully but it was eventually given to Gillain Anderson. In 1990, she appeared in the Broadway musical “Buddy – The Buddy Holly Story” and three years later would be cast in “RoboCop 3” as Dr. Marie Lazarus. In the same year, she was cast in the crime drama “Law & Order” as assistant district attorney Claire Kincaid, a role she would play for three seasons until leaving the show with her character dying via a car crash.</p><p>In 1999, she then appeared in “Chutney Popcorn”, and the following year became part of the mockumentary “The Acting Class” – which she produced, wrote, and co-directed – about a dysfunctional acting class. She co-starred in the film alongside her twin sister, which also featured several cameo appearances. She then starred in the film “Nuremberg”, and two years later, she was cast in the film “Jackie, Ethel, Joan: The Women of Camelot”, portraying ex-first lady Jackie Kennedy. A cameo appearance followed in the film “Abby Singer”, all of which added to her net worth.</p><p>Her next long-term role would be in the television show “Crossing Jordan”, playing the lead Jordan Cavanaugh from 2001 to 2007, and would then appear as the wife of <a href=#>Tim Allen</a> in the film “Wild Hogs”. She also received a star on the Canada’s Walk of Fame in 2007.</p><p>Hennessy is also known to do music work, recording the album “Ghost in My Head” which was released in 2009. She performed numerous times in the same year, including at the Village Stage of the 2010 Lilith Fair. In the same year, she starred in the independent film “Small Town Murder Songs”, and would appear in the HBO series “Luck”. One of her latest projects is her second album “I Do” released in 2015, so her net worth is still growing.</p><p>For her personal life, it is known that Jill has been married to Paolo Mastropietro since 2000. They had a second marriage ceremony in 2001, and now have two sons. Hennessy is multi-lingual, speaking German, French, Italian, Spanish, and English. She also enjoys riding motorcycles, singing, and playing the guitar.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=27.404511278195><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Jill Hennessy</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$12 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>November 25, 1968</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Edmonton, Alberta, Canada</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>5' 8" (1.73 m)</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Actress</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Education</td><td>Monash University, University of Melbourne</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Paolo Mastropietro</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Children</td><td>Marco Mastropietro, Gianni Mastropietro</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Parents</td><td>John Hennessy, Maxine Hennessy</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Siblings</td><td>Jacqueline Hennessy, John Paul "J.P."
