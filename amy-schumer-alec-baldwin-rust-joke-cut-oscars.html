During the set, which was part of the casino’s Aces of Comedy series, the comedian also revealed some of her jokes that she contends were cut from the hosting gig.</p><p>“I don’t even know what to say about the Oscars. Like, I really don’t know what to say. I have no jokes about it,” Schumer told the crowd, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">according to Vanity Fair</a>. All I can say is that I don’t know if you saw this, but Will Smith slapped Chris Rock. Did you read that in your newsfeed?”</p><p>She continued, referring to Smith as “Ali,” from his 2001 film of the same name about the life of the boxer Muhammad Ali.</p><p>“I was kind of feeling myself…and then all of a sudden, Ali was making his way up,” recalled Schumer. “And it was just a fucking bummer. All I can say is that it was really sad, and I think it says so much about toxic masculinity. It was really upsetting, but I think the best way to comfort ourselves would be for me to say the Oscar jokes that I wasn’t allowed to say on TV.”</p><p>One joke in particular, however, about the shooting on the set of Rust, sounds like it was best left on the cutting room floor.</p><p>“Don’t Look Up is the name of a movie? More like don’t look down the barrel of Alec Baldwin’s shotgun,” she said. “I wasn’t allowed to say any of that [at the Oscars], but you can just come up and [slap] someone.”</p><p>Cinematographer Halyna Hutchins was killed during filming when Alec Baldwin fired a prop gun that discharged a live round, with subsequent investigations into the incident indicating the weapon had not been thoroughly checked for safety before filming the scene. The family of Hutchins has since <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">sued Baldwin</a> over the shooting, but the actor <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">continues to maintain his innocence</a>.</p><p>Some of Schumer’s other cut jokes apparently involved Joe Rogan and the James Franco sexual misconduct allegations.</p><p>On social media following the Oscars, Schumer said that she was “triggered and traumatized” by Smith slapping Rock.</p><p>“I think we can all agree that the best way to unpack what happened is to stream my series Life & Beth and see me on tour this fall,” Schumer wrote in a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">since-deleted Instagram post</a>. “But for real. Still triggered and traumatized. I love my friend Chris Rock and believe he handled it like a pro. Stayed up there and gave an Oscar to his friend Questlove and the whole thing was so disturbing. So much pain in Will Smith anyway … I’m still in shock and stunned and sad. I’m proud of myself and my cohosts. But yeah. Waiting for this sickening feeling to go away from what we all witnessed.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsS0e8CmsGark53CrrHRZpilnZNir6K4w7Cgp2WiqsC1ecmoop5lk6rBbrvSnJirq18%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogInfo - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
