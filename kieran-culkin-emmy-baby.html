It’s far from his first award this season for the role of Roman Roy, one of three Roy children fighting to take over their father’s media conglomerate — he also won big at the Golden Globes and the Critics Choice Awards. An awards trifecta is, of course, reason enough for celebration — but it was also, according to Culkin, the perfect time to remind his wife of a sort of promise she had made him months ago.</p><p>As he accepted his award and thanked his wife, Jazz Charton, her for “giving [him] two amazing kids,” he added, “And, Jazz, I want more. You said maybe, if I win!”</p><p>Culkin later explained that he had been talking to his wife about having a third kid (the couple already share two children, Kinsey Sioux and Wilder Wolf).</p><p>“I’ve been asking for a while,” Culkin reported, <a href=# rel=noreferrer>per People</a>. “Jazz said, ‘Maybe if you win the Emmy.’” Then Culkin bided his time: “I didn't bring it up for months.”</p><p>When he brought it back up to her after winning the Golden Globe, he said his wife spent “the whole week being nervous.”</p><p>Only time will tell, of course, if Culkin and Charton do have another child. But if they do, we already know what Culkin won’t be naming them — “Emmy, or whatever other cute little thing,” said Culkin, is off the table.</p><p>Emmy, however, has a lot going for it. Latin and German in origin, Emmy means “powerful, strong, whole, exalted, rival and equal,” according to <a href=# rel=noreferrer>The Bump</a>, and is <a href=#>ultra on-trend</a> as an uncommon, vowel-heavy, short name with just one or two syllables. Those are the names that are all the rage at the moment, and for the foreseeable future — baby-naming experts suggest that long, traditional names like Elizabeth and Ezekiel are out. <a href=#>Expect instead to see a resurgence in names like Eli, Ellie, and Zeke</a>. In fact, Emmy is also a perfect nickname for names like Emerson, Emmeline, or Emilia. Since Kieran’s not using it, perhaps another famous Culkin can.</p><p><span>more</span> like this</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7p63ToZyrpKljsLC5jp6lrZ2iqa6qusyepa1nm56ys63NZpqupJueu26xzKawZpqRl8Y%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogInfo - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
