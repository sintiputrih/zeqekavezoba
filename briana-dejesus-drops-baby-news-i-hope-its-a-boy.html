She added: “I want one more child and I hope it’s a boy.”</p><p>“Hopefully I can make that happen sooner than later,” she said, winking at the camera.</p><p>Briana may be planning to have a baby with her current boyfriend, <strong>Bobby Scott</strong>, with whom things are apparently quite serious.</p><p>“I feel like in the past I’ve dated without purpose, and now I’m dating with purpose,” she recently told <a href=#>Page Six</a>. “I’m enjoying my life right now, and there’s a lot to come.”</p><h4 class="slide_title cpxi-italic-title"></h4><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/briana-dejesus-backstage-reunion.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=wp-caption-text id=caption>Credit: MTV</p><p>In the meantime, Briana and <a href=#><strong>Ashley Jones</strong></a>‘s latest feud has been so intense that it played a part in the recent strike of the Teen Mom: Family Reunion filming, and apparently it’s resulted in Briana receiving some ugly threats.</p><p>Briana shared that she’s been receiving some disturbing messages via Instagram, including one that she posted on her story.</p><p>“Please just [kill] yourself and do your family and the world a favor we all [f*cking] hate you including your own family,” the message read.</p><p>“Learn respect especially putting your hands on a pregnant person Ashley should have [redacted] senseless let me see you cause the minute I do it’s on site [redacted].”</p><p>Briana penned her response to this, writing: “Spreading lies can really get someone hurt. Im tired of ppl thinking im the one that caused any type of mayhem. I never assaulted anyone. I never put my hands on anyone. I never started that fight in oregon.”</p><h4 class="slide_title cpxi-italic-title"></h4><p>“I never even got disrespect til a pregnant woman who is accusing me I knew about her pregnancy but never told me asked me if I wanted to fight,” Briana continued. “Lol make it make sense. A high risk pregnancy at that. Asking to fight and spitting on ppl. It’s disgusting.”</p><p>Despite Briana’s controversial status, many were quick to come to her defense.</p><p>“People are so f*cking weird,” one viewer wrote on reddit. “Why you that amped up over a reality TV personalities drama to send abusive messages like this? They must have very boring lives.”</p><p>“Who the hell is ready to threaten/kill over Ashley on Teen Mom? What a f*cking weirdo loser not case, needs to be someone’s client for sending that garbage!” another wrote.</p><p><a href=#>The Ashley’s Reality Roundup</a> reported that the co-stars got sent home after a huge brawl.</p><p>Along with Briana and Ashley, their moms <strong>Roxanne Dejesus</strong> and <strong>Pastor Tea Chapple</strong> were also asked to leave. The ladies were all kicked out after getting involved in the physical altercation, which broke rules set by production.</p><p>It began at a meal shared by the cast. “Roxanne made a comment about how the grandmas from the show need to be supportive of each other and [Tea] took it as a jab at her,” an insider spilled to the outlet. “She told Roxanne to say what she wanted to say, so Roxanne started talking about some of the stuff Tea has said about Briana on social media.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmusqpjsLC5jqBmm6qZlruiecOeoZ6rpah6pb7OqapmmpGXxm66xLCqZqFdnbyxsYyiq6xlkWKvsMWO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogInfo - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
