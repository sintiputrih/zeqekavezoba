Did you get the pinwheel eyes? You know what I'm talking about. She's not all there" Griffin told a confused King.</p><p>King responded, "So what's your point? What point are you trying to make here?"</p><p>Griffin replied, "I'm saying that I hope you were gentle with her, because she's a fragile ... sorry, I just wanted to know if you got through to her in a way that her doctors couldn't."</p><p>It seems like Griffin was just bitter that she didn't make a lasting impression on the "Baby One More Time" singer. She explained, "I actually appeared in her Vegas show. She has someone every night come up, and they put a harness on me, and I was her sex slave for a song that she sings called 'Freakshow' ... I've known her since she was 16 â€” so I thought, at the end, we're onstage, it's a triumphant moment for really both of us. And then I thought, 'She's going to want to say, 'Good to see you again,' and I say, 'Brit, it's so great to see you.' She didn't know who I was. Then her gay backup dancer from heaven said, 'Kathy Griffin.' And she said, 'Give it up for Kathy, y'all!' And that's all I ask, Britney."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmb3Bja4Bwv8eam7Jlo56xpnnKmquhsV2cv6qyxaKlaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogInfo - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
