A man whose identity was not revealed persisted in photographing Zoe and her dad despite being asked to stop.</p><p>According to the Metropolitan Police Department, Zoe’s dad punched the man only after the man initiated a confrontation absolving Woody of any charge. The incident occurred around 11 p.m., prompting a police response to reports of an assault on the hotel’s roof deck.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/woody.jpg><p>The Watergate Hotel spokesperson and Woody’s agency refrained from commenting on the incident. But the public had much to say, and curiosity about Zoe has gone off the roof ever since. Everyone is eager to know about Woody’s daughter, whom “he fought for.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Zoe_Giordano_Harrelson></span>Who Is&nbsp;Zoe Giordano Harrelson?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Zoe Giordano Harrelson, famous for being Woody Harrelson’s daughter, is an American citizen, born on September 22, 1996, in the United States. She is currently 26 years old and was raised by her parents.</p><p>Her paternal grandparents are Charles Harrelson and Diane Lou Oswald, while her paternal great-grandparents are Alma Harrelson and Voyde Harrelson. Zoe has a diverse ethnic background with White, Asian, and American ancestry. She possesses white skin, brown eyes, and long, dark brown hair.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Zoe_Giordano_Harrelsons_Educational_Background></span>Zoe Giordano Harrelson’s Educational Background<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Zoe had completed her elementary school, obtained her high school diploma, and is done with college. However, before all this, Zoe was homeschooled. But after her father admitted that homeschooling Zoe alongside her siblings wasn’t the best action, he decided it was time for a regular school. This was just in time for high school.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/woody-1.jpg><p>Zoe then attended Seabury Hall, a college preparatory school in Maui County, Hawaii. Zoe became involved in theater, singing, sketching, and creative writing. She made some appearances in a few productions from the theater club at school, which she was a part of.</p><p>It’s no doubt that Zoe looks up to her father as an inspiration to become an actor. Zoe graduated high school in 2015. Though we have no information about her subsequent education, most believe she attended college and received a Bachelor’s degree in theater in 2019.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_Does_Zoe_Giordano_Harrelson_Do_for_a_Living></span>What Does Zoe Giordano Harrelson Do for a Living?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Zoe prefers to keep a low profile, so it’s difficult to say what she does for a living. However, in 2015, she made an onscreen debut alongside her dad in a U2 music video called Song for Someone.</p><p>She was also involved in another project, a 2017 comedy film “Lost in London,” written by Zoe, directed and co-starred in collaboration with Daniel Radcliffe and Owen Wilson. The movie received exceptional praise.</p><p>Zoe hasn’t appeared in any high-profile movies lately. We don’t know what she has been up to, but we can’t help but think she is currently working on an upcoming project.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Are_Zoe_Giordano_Harrelsons_Parents></span>Who Are Zoe Giordano Harrelson’s Parents?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>While much isn’t known about Zoe’s mum’s background, we know she is Asian.

Before his marriage with Laura, Woody Harrelson was briefly married to Nancy Simon, but their marriage ended less than a year.</p><p>Zoe’s parents have experienced their fair share of marital challenges. News circulated that Woody cheated on Laura with <a href=#>three </a>women while on a work trip. However, the couple managed to work things out. They love each other and have taken steps to protect their marriage.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_Zoe_Giordano_Harrelson_an_Only_Child></span>Is Zoe Giordano Harrelson an Only Child?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Zoe has two siblings from her mum and dad. Deni Motana Harrelson, her elder sister, born on February 28, 1993. Makani Ravello Harrelson, her younger sister, born June 3, 2006.</p><p>Deni has avoided the limelight asides from a few red-carpet appearances with her dad. The same goes for Makani, whom we don’t know much about.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_Is_Zoe_Giordano_Harrelsons_Net_Worth></span>What Is Zoe Giordano Harrelson’s Net Worth?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Zoe Giordano Harrelson’s net worth is not publicly known, unlike her father, Woody Harrelson, who is estimated to have a net worth of approximately $70 million. Likewise, Zoe’s mother, Laura Louie, is estimated to have a net worth of around $3.85 million.</p><p>Woody Harrelson accumulated wealth primarily through his acting career, while Laura Louie earns her income from her organic food delivery service.
