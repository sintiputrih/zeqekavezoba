If we’re not in the market for a specific item, we’re pulled in so many directions. That’s why it’s good to have a strategy — and for Us, that means doing a deep dive on an item’s reviews.</p><p>When a piece is officially dubbed an Amazon bestseller, we’re immediately intrigued. The latest and greatest garment to earn the title is <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener">this cowl neck wrap cardigan</a>! Shoppers are obsessed, which inspired Us to do some research!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Asvivid-Womens-Button-Turtle-Cowl-Neck-Asymmetric-Hem-Wrap-Pullover-Sweater.png><p><strong>Get the </strong><span id=productTitle class="a-size-large product-title-word-break"><strong><a href=# rel="sponsored noopener">Asvivid Women’s Button Turtle Cowl Neck Asymmetric Hem Wrap Pullover Sweater</a> for prices starting at just <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener">$10</a>, available at Amazon!</strong> <strong>Please note, prices are accurate at the date of publication, December 15, 2020, but are subject to change.</strong></span></p><p>What instantly caught our eye is <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener">this sweater’s</a> asymmetrical design, which almost resembles a wrap-style top! The buttons holding the two sides together run diagonally across the front, and meet at the neckline to the side. There’s also a button closure that accents the cowl neck and ties the look together!</p><p>This sweater has a <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener">classic knit pattern</a> that’s serving up waffle vibes. The material is thicker and cozier than your average tee, and considering it’s prime time for winter layering, this is a valuable addition. You can wear this top on its own, or with tanks and camis underneath. If you’re feeling bold, a fitted turtleneck will elevate the ensemble!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Asvivid-Womens-Button-Turtle-Cowl-Neck-Asymmetric-Hem-Wrap-Pullover-Sweater-2.png><p><strong>Get the </strong><span id=productTitle class="a-size-large product-title-word-break"><strong><a href=# rel="sponsored noopener">Asvivid Women’s Button Turtle Cowl Neck Asymmetric Hem Wrap Pullover Sweater</a> for prices starting at just <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener">$10</a>, available at Amazon!</strong> <strong>Please note, prices are accurate at the date of publication, December 15, 2020, but are subject to change.</strong></span></p><p>This <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener">knit sweate</a><a href=# rel="sponsored noopener">r</a> has a casual vibe, but can surely be worn for more formal scenarios!
