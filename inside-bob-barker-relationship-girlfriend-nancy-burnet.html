Barker supported the United Activists for Animal Rights, a group founded by Burnet. Likewise, Burnet supported Barker in founding the DJ&T Foundation, an affordable spay and neutering program that she would later take over for him.</p><p>Their shared passion and commitment to animal rights made them a powerful force. Working together, they led an investigation into the treatment of animals during the filming of "Project X," resulting in criminal charges for animal cruelty. It was one of many fights they would go into together. Over the years, the pair organized and participated in protests, rescued animals, and did their best to raise awareness for animal welfare. Along with projects in the US, they took the fight for animal rights with them to the many locations they traveled together.</p><p>Speaking to People, Burnet discussed how valuable it was to have a celebrity like Barker using his platform to speak up for animals. "He was willing to stand up when things were controversial," Burnet said. She went on to explain the difference his promotion for having pets spayed and neutered made. "I can't tell you the millions of animals, because of his name value and his speaking out, that were not born doomed, never to be adopted, because there just aren't enough homes."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEpaCsrF6YvK57kGxva2xpaHyqutKim55lkqSvbq7Aq6Keql2nsq2t06Kmp6uYnr1us8iro5%2BqmZq7pXnNmqWcsV2XwrO6xK1m</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogInfo - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
