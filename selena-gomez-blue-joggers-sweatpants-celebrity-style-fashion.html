On top of being a talented actress and singer, she made a major impact on the beauty world with Rare Beauty just a few months ago, and clothing-wise, she is always dressed to the nines, even when she’s keeping it totally casual.</p><p>We may not be able to land any starring movie or TV roles right now, but what we can do is <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">recreate Gomez’s looks</a>. She was just spotted on the set of Only Murders in the Building, her upcoming comedy series, and we quickly fell for her comfy-cool outfit. She was dressed in a light wool coat, PUMA <a href=# data-link=1>sneakers</a>, a face mask, a blue crew neck and blue joggers. The blue joggers definitely lit a spark in our minds. We wanted a pair of our own, but we didn’t quite want to spend <a href=# rel=noopener>$78 on the Free People pair she wore</a>. That’s why we found our own version on Amazon for a fraction of the price!</p><figure class=wp-caption></figure><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">esstive Ultra Soft Fleece Basic Midweight Casual Solid Jogger Pants in Blue</a> for just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$20</a> at Amazon!

They have a stretchy waistband with a wide drawstring and a slim fit, tapering in totally at the ankles. Outside, they’re soft, but the fleece inside is truly a dream. Other extremely important details include the roomy side seam pockets and back patch pockets! It’s not often you find back pockets on a pair of <a href=# data-link=1>sweats</a> or joggers, so this is a big bonus!</p><figure class=wp-caption></figure><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">esstive Ultra Soft Fleece Basic Midweight Casual Solid Jogger Pants in Blue</a> for just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$20</a> at Amazon!

A pair of blue joggers will automatically earn you style points. Grey and black are classics, but a brighter shade like this will catch stares. You can also check out the Marled Smoky Blue version for another similar effect.</p><p>There are actually <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">over 30 colors</a> total, so don’t feel like you need to stick to blue either! Try a pink, yellow, red, charcoal or peach shade, or perhaps something with a stripe detail. They’re all waiting on Amazon for you to check out, so let’s get to it!</p><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">esstive Ultra Soft Fleece Basic Midweight Casual Solid Jogger Pants in Blue</a> for just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$20</a> at Amazon!
