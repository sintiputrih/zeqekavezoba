It was the first safety since <a href=#>Jared Allen</a> had one on December 4, 2011 against the Denver Broncos. Hunter had his first career multi-sack game in Week 11 against the Arizona Cardinals, helping the Vikings end their four-game losing streak. Against the Dallas Cowboys in Week 13, Hunter had his second two-sack game of the season. In 16 games with the Vikings in 2016, Hunter accumulated 54 total tackles, 12.5 sacks (including a safety), one forced fumble, and one fumble recovery for a touchdown despite the fact that he did not start a single game.

Hunter was the only Viking to be featured on NFL.com analyst Elliot Harrison's All-Under-25 team.</p><p>Hunter returned as a starter for his junior year in 2014.

Against Mississippi State, he had six tackles, a sack and scooped up a Dak Prescott fumble on the first play of the second half, racing 25 yards for a touchdown. After setting a career-high in tackles with 12 against Auburn in week 4, he became the first LSU defensive lineman with double-digit tackles in a game since <a href=#>Glenn Dorsey</a> had 11 tackles against Ole Miss on November 28, 2006.
