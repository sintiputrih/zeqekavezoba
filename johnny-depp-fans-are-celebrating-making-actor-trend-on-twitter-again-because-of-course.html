The judge ruled no “fraud or wrongdoing” took place and ultimately said the jury’s judgment had to stand as originally issued. That means Heard will still owe Depp $10 million while Depp owes Heard $2 million, with the verdict being the two actors defamed each other.</p><p data-characters=195 data-current-count=195 data-injectable=false>Shortly after the Virginia judge’s reaffirmation of the verdict, Depp fans began celebrating the actor on social media, to the point where #JohnnyDeppKeepsWinning began trending on Twitter.</p><p data-characters=50 data-current-count=245 data-injectable=false>“Love seeing this 🔥” one fan wrote.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=545 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>Love seeing this 🔥<a href=#>#JohnnyDeppKeepsWinning</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/invejoVU8d</a></p>— Libby 🐝🏴‍☠️🥚 #JusticeServedForJohnnyDepp (@DeppSoldier_22) <a href=#>July 14, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=156 data-current-count=156 data-injectable=false>One Twitter user took the opportunity to celebrate Judge Azcarate herself, who has arguably had to endure some dizzying highs and lows throughout the trial.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=456 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>🌷 Younger Judge Azcarate 🌷</p><p>What a lovely lady what a good judge! <a href=#>#JohnnyDeppWon</a> <a href=#>#JusticeForJohnnyDepp</a><a href=#>#JohnnyDeppIsASurvivor</a> <a href=#>#JohnnyDeppKeepsWinning</a><a href=#>#ElaineBredehoftisALiar</a><a href=#>#AmberHeardlsALiar</a> <a href=#>#AmberHeardIsAGolddigger</a> <a href=#>#MePoo</a> <a href=#>#JudgeAzcarate</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/WoZTXuOUJe</a></p>— ✨Momzy✨ (@brendamomster) <a href=#>July 14, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=125 data-current-count=125 data-injectable=false>Another fan shared a photo from Depp’s recent concert guest appearances with Jeff Beck to help celebrate the legal win.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=425 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr><a href=#>#JohnnyDeppKeepsWinning</a><a href=#>#JohnnyDeppLivingHappilyEverAfter</a></p><p>Why?</p><p>Beauty, music, truth, justice, laughter, love…</p><p>❤️</p><p>📸 @team_depp IG <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/MbdfTntwdD</a></p>— greybalance (@greybalance1) <a href=#>July 14, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=101 data-current-count=101 data-injectable=false>Depp fans were also simply fixated on the trend itself and what it means to them more than anything.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=401 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>Indeed he does. 😁❤️❤️<a href=#>#JohnnyDeppKeepsWinning</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/ECqGqG2ClV</a></p>— 💫✨Cheyenne (#Rando) 🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍⚧️🇪🇺❄️ (@_MsShiny_1997) <a href=#>July 14, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=514 data-current-count=514 data-injectable=true>After a six-week-long trial, the jury found that Heard defamed Depp in all three of Depp’s questions to the jury centering on a 2018 op-ed Heard penned for the Washington Post. Though Depp was not named in the article, the jury verdict was that Heard falsely implied he was a domestic abuser in the piece. Ultimately, the jury also sided with just one of several of Heard’s claims of being defamed, finding that Depp’s former lawyer falsely told the press that Heard staged a hoax at one point.</p><p data-characters=310 data-current-count=310 data-injectable=false>In a previous trial in the UK, Depp sued publishers of The Sun for libel after the tabloid wrote that he abused Heard but lost. The High Court of Justice found 12 out of 14 claims of violence to be “substantially true.” The trial, however, was not televised and therefore drew less media attention.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S3sLTNp7BmnJWlvW6ywKeqZpmimnqkscuemauZpJ67qHnMmqKippdirqTAzqtkraqVo7Fuu81mq7ChpKmys3nAoJiipl2XsqSt1KycZqeWYrCwwdGsnGg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogInfo - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
