After that Belly and Conrad kiss at the end of season 1, we are eager to return to our favorite summer love.&nbsp;</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=439 data-current-count=439 data-injectable=true>Season 2 of The Summer I Turned Pretty is based on the second book in author <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Jenny Han</strong></a>‘s trilogy that follows Belly Conklin as she falls in love for the first time with herself and chases her life-long passion for Conrad Fisher. Of course, there were other summer boys that she shared kisses and made memories with, but “for Belly, Conrad is the sun” — and she’s always had an out-of-this-world pull toward him.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=213 data-current-count=213 data-injectable=false>Han shared a preview of season 2 with readers during a chat with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Entertainment Weekly</a>, and in the snippet of a script she gave us is a romantic moment for a couple still in that butterflies stage of first love.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=243 data-current-count=456 data-injectable=true>The scene in question? It’s a piece of Conrad and Belly’s story that fans were hoping would make the finale cut, and you’re not alone if you’re suddenly craving hot cocoa and a dreamy summer love to share it with.&nbsp;</p><p>“Any time that there is a scene in the books that I know is really important to the readers, it’s something that I try to keep sacred for the show. I had talked to both Chris and Lola a lot about the scene and we were all really excited about it. We knew how important the scene was for the fans. The books came out so long ago and people have read them and re-read them, and so they have those words really imprinted in their memories. I want to deliver on those promises for certain specific scenes, and this is one of those scenes that I wanted to give to the fans.”</p><p data-characters=233 data-current-count=233 data-injectable=false>Team Belly is the winning team as far as We Got This Covered is concerned, and I’ve already rewatched The Summer I Turned Pretty three times in the last month, so I’ve got a pretty good grasp on their power couple status.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=533 data-injectable=true><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by The Summer I Turned Pretty (@thesummeriturnedpretty)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=642 data-current-count=642 data-injectable=true>As one of the most iconic scenes between Belly and Conrad, we’re all thrilled to know that Han considers the wishes of her dedicated readers as she’s crafting which book pieces make it to the series and which storylines to let flourish. Of course, Han will change some things as the story continues, but this fan-favorite moment is something we’re glad she’s keeping in. It’s a series of firsts for Belly and Conrad, and an essential piece of this story is that it’s also happening in the summer house, but with hot cocoa as their drink of choice, it’s clear that they’re there in winter.&nbsp;</p><p>“I wanted to really show what it felt like for these two people to be sneaking into this house in the wintertime — it’s dark and it’s cold, and they’ve never been there before at this time of year together, and no one else is there. It feels like this really fun secret. There’s something really cozy and special about this moment, almost like it’s out of time. Here they are, and no one else is walking in — it’s really a private moment. I don’t think they’ve ever been in the house alone like that before because it’s always filled with people.”</p><p data-characters=352 data-current-count=352 data-injectable=false>Han’s script sees the couple “playing house” as she’s scribbled in the notes, and as far as young love goes, that’s one of the most magical pieces. Imagining a future with just you two, doing simple things like drinking cocoa and cleaning the mud room together — trust me, that sort of magic is worth holding onto.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=362 data-current-count=714 data-injectable=false>If you’re behind on&nbsp;The Summer I Turned Pretty, now is the time to catch up before new episodes begin airing in July on Prime Video. Oh, and don’t forget to grab your Team Conrad t-shirt before you sit down to watch or rewatch the adorable series this summer; we know you’ll pick the right great love for Belly; we’ve got faith in you.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yrsc2nsGagkaN6pLvNn6CrpaNiwamt02aZnqScrnqiusNmmqimopaxbsPIpaNmq6Seua15xqKtnmWlqHqjwdOtnKuenJ6ytHnIp2StoJViwLa5zJ6pZqFdqcKzusSdZKmqlanBunnSnpisp55if3A%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogInfo - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
