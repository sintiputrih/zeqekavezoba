And one thing is very clear. She did <i>not </i>wake up like that.</p><p>The burlesque performer begins her days pretty simply with "quiet harp sounds or little bells" and a glass of lemon-infused water. A basic rundown of her beauty routine sounds typical enough — "Drinking water, taking vitamins, washing my face, and moisturizing. Obviously, brushing teeth comes before everything though!" But it's clear that Dita is not like the rest of us. She goes to Pilates every morning (usually wearing "a swipe of red lipstick"), drinks a green smoothie for breakfast, and spends anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour getting glam:</p>My look seems high-maintenance, and maybe it is for some people, but it’s been my everyday routine for over 20 years, so I can do it quickly and easily — which is why I rarely like a glam squad. They require between three to four hours to make me 'me'!<p>Dita devotes more time getting ready for her Pilates workout than most of us devote to getting ready to go out with friends. She goes through her basic makeup routine, eats breakfast, and puts on her Pilates "uniform" — "black capri pants, fitted black or white T-shirt, ballet flats and either a coat or skirt. I always do a sweep of powder and matte red lipstick, and always a chignon."</p><p>A <i>chignon</i>. To <i>exercise class</i>. Insane pre-workout beauty regimen aside, Dita has some sound advice for the average person. After all, we'd probably feel a lot better if we took our time to begin the day properly, rather than hitting the 'snooze' button five times, taking a scalding hot shower, and running out the door without eating breakfast. "The morning is about a practiced, healthy discipline that I can see the effects of, so I stay true to a routine as best I can," Dita told Vogue.com.</p><p>Hey, if it will make me <a href=# class=T3D>look more like Dita</a> I will gladly wear red lipstick to Pilates class.</p><figure class="Qf5 nbP" readability=2><p>John Sciulli/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images</p></figure><p>Get Even More From Bustle — Sign Up For The Newsletter</p><p>From hair trends to relationship advice, our daily newsletter has everything you need to sound like a person who’s on TikTok, even if you aren’t.</p><p>More like this</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSraOeZpOkunCt0a2gnKSVqHxzfJRxaWacmamubsLOp2StnZWosm6%2BxK%2BcmqSjYrWmvoyipayZnpp6rrvRp6Cnn12nvLbAyKec</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogInfo - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
