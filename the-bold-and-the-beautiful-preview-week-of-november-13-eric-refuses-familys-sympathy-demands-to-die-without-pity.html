Eric Forrester (John McCook) declares that he doesn‚Äôt live his life with pity, and won‚Äôt die with it.</p><p>Meanwhile, several members of the Forrester and Logan families learn about Eric‚Äôs grim fate. So, let‚Äôs get started discussing what is coming up in the CBS soap opera.</p><p><strong>Brooke Logan Forrester‚Äôs Bombshell</strong></p><p>B&B spoilers for the week of November 13 reveal that the preview video shows Brooke trying to deliver some tough news to her daughter. Brooke tells Hope Logan (Annika Noelle) that Eric is dying.</p><p>Hope will be completely shocked by this news. Hope might do the same thing as Ridge Forrester (Thorsten Kaye) and ask about alternative treatments. ‚Äò</p><p>Hope might be even more shocked by what Brooke says next. Since Eric doesn‚Äôt want anyone to know he is dying, Brooke will likely tell Hope to keep it to herself.</p><p>Of course, Thomas Forrester (Matthew Atkinson) will soon find out as well. That will provide some opportunities for ‚ÄúThope‚Äù to bond on a deeper level.</p><p><strong>B&B Spoilers: Steffy‚Äôs Reaction</strong></p><p>Speaking of Thomas, both he and Steffy Forrester Finnegan (Jacqueline MacInnes Wood) will learn the truth during the week of November 13.</p><p>Ridge had a chance to tell Steffy about Eric when she came back from Paris. However, Steffy already has her hands full, so Ridge didn‚Äôt think it was the right time.</p><p>The preview video clip shows Brooke standing by Ridge‚Äôs side as he tells his children the truth. Both Steffy and Thomas are stunned to learn that Eric only has a few months to live.</p><p>Immediately, Steffy announces that she needs to see Eric. That must be when Ridge tells Steffy and Thomas that Eric doesn‚Äôt want anyone to know about his diagnosis.</p><p><strong>Donna Logan‚Äôs Frustration</strong></p><p>The Bold and the Beautiful spoilers for the week of November 13 reveal that the preview video shows Eric continuing to make declarations.</p><p>Eric will announce once again that he doesn‚Äôt want anyone‚Äôs pity. A very frustrated and agitated Eric says he doesn‚Äôt live his life with pity and certainly won‚Äôt die that way, either.</p><p>After Eric‚Äôs powerful but heartbreaking declaration, Katie simply looks down at her feet without saying a word.</p><p>However, Donna‚Äôs face implies she is getting fed up with Eric‚Äôs tough guy stance.</p><p><strong>The Bold and the Beautiful Spoilers: Eric Forrester‚Äôs Way</strong></p><p>Eric got his way with the fashion showdown and now is sitting at the throne of Forrester Creations, just as he wished.</p><p>So, with Eric continuing to insist that he will live and die his way, what exactly does that mean?</p><p>Fans will also see some scenes of Katie tearfully hugging Eric. Plus, Ridge tells Brooke that he doesn‚Äôt want to lose his dad. So, expect a lot of tear-jerking scenes.</p><p>Be sure to catch up on everything happening with B&B right now.
