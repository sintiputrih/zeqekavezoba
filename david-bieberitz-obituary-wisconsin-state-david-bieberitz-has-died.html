Wiederich, who had lived in Le Sueur throughout his life and had reached the age of 58 when he passed away, passed away unexpectedly on December 18, 2023. At one o’clock in the afternoon on Saturday, December 23, 2023, there will be a memorial service which will be performed in honor of the deceased.</p><p>On the evening of Friday, December 22, 2023, visiting will begin at four o’clock and continue until seven o’clock. It will also continue for one hour prior to the Memorial Service. Both of these proceedings will take place at the Kolden Funeral Home, which is located in LeSueur. After the service is over, there will be a reception with refreshments and honors for the military personnel.</p><p>David Wiederich was born on November 12, 1965, in the town of Canby, which is located in the state of Minnesota. It was Howard Wiederich and Kathryn (Doble) Wiederich who were his parents. It was in the Redwood Falls area that he spent his boyhood, and it was at Redwood Falls High School that he graduated with his high school diploma in the year 1985.</p><p>Following the completion of his high school education, Dave was able to secure employment in a variety of settings, including local eateries, construction, Casino Magic in Mississippi, and other career opportunities. He joined the National Guard in 1991 and has been a member ever since. Erin Granberg and he tied the knot on September 22, 2012, and the wedding ceremony took place at the Caribou Gun Club in LeSueur.</p><p>Between the months of August 2022 and August 2022, Dave worked at the St. Peter Regional Treatment Center for a total of sixteen years until he made the decision to retire. Dave was well-known for his amazing sense of humor, which he used to make the people he cared about happy (and on sometimes, to make them angry). His reputation as a player of practical jokes flourished during the course of his career.</p><p>Despite the fact that he mocked them, Dave was always willing and able to help a friend and a cat (or two or three) who were in need of assistance. Whenever he worked on something, his big heart was obvious to everyone around him. Dave’s retirement allowed him to engage in a wide range of outdoor pursuits, including fishing and hunting, as well as the construction of the largest boat hanger in the region. He was able to devote his time to these hobbies.</p>0<span class=mashsb-sharetext>SHARES</span><a class="mashicon-facebook mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Share</span></a><a class="mashicon-twitter mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Tweet</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmihnqG8t7XNoKSepZ%2Bntqa%2FzZ6urGaTpLpwsMCvoJ1lkp6yo7HRoquzZZ%2BXtrXBwKuwZq%2BZqLCwutKipWarpJbBpnnDmq2inF2XtqauxKugrbJdna60ecOinJ1n</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogInfo - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
