Brandi Cyrus has landed her first magazine cover — and she looks absolutely stunning!</p><p>Miley Cyrus’ older half-sister, who made a splash at the 2013 American Music Awards while conducting red carpet interviews, covers the December issue of <a href=#>Nationalist magazine</a> and looks flawless in the accompanying spread. On the cover, the strawberry blonde-haired Cyrus sibling, 26, wears a black sleeved top with a netted open back, and looks down with a pensive gaze over her left shoulder.</p><p>Inside the issue, the Frank and Derol guitarist, who has played on tour with her pop star sister and dad <strong><a href=#>Billy Ray Cyrus</a></strong>, opens up about relationships, and of course, her most famous younger sibling. The fresh face also flaunts her willowy frame in numerous leg-baring outfits in the magazine — casually laying in a bathtub filled with purple water in one, and leaning against a piano in another. (Brandi and brother<strong> Trace</strong>, 24, are <strong>Tish Cyrus</strong>‘ kids from a previous relationship. Billy Ray, 52, adopted the two shortly after he married Tish, 54, in 1993; The couple also share kids <strong>Miley</strong>,<strong> Braison</strong>, 19, and <strong>Noah</strong>, 13. Billy Ray also has a son, <strong>Christopher Cody</strong>, 21, from his brief relationship with a waitress.)</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>With Miley’s <a href=#>romantic travails</a> with ex-fiance <strong><a href=#>Liam Hemsworth</a></strong> making national headlines, Brandi Explains she stays cautious in matters of love. “Relationships are hard,” she said. “I’ve had my fair share of relationships, including some long distance ones,” revealed the musician, who splits her time between Nashville and L.A. “The heart department is messy, therefore I tread lightly.”</p><p>Despite the five year age gap between Brandi and her pop sensation sibling, she told the mag that she admires Miley’s individuality: “She is SO true to herself and 100 percent authentic,” explained Cyrus. “Which is a rare trait to find in people in general, but especially in the entertainment industry where everyone is held to such unrealistic standards and trying to make an impression and be perceived a certain way.”</p><p>She also defended the “Wrecking Ball” crooner’s recent, highly-publicized antics, including her infamous VMAs performance back in August. “I think that Miley is getting a chance to be who she really is, after years of having to be a fictional character on TV,” said Brandi of Miley’s Hannah Montana origins. “I also know from experience that your 20s are full of things that shape who you are and it takes awhile to figure it all out. I’m 26 and I’m still learning who I am and who I want to be. Miley is in the very beginning of that journey.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX5e%2ForrDomScsaKqwG64zqiirGWjqcKvusinnmannmK6orPAs6CnnV2YvLex0Wabnp6Vo7G0ecyio56xXWd9cn%2BUamlo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogInfo - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
