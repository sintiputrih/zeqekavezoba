It has been awhile since the multiple award winning singer has looked this happy. Sam split from 13 Reasons Why actor Brandon Flynn in 2018 and was rumored to be dating former Vote Leave volunteer, Shahmir Sanni in May after the activist posted a loving message on twitter to the singer. *Shot on August 25, 2020*Pictured: Sam Smith, Francois RocciBACKGRID USA 27 AUGUST 2020BYLINE MUST READ: NASH / BACKGRIDUSA: +1 310 798 9111 / <a href=# class=__cf_email__ data-cfemail=99eceaf8eaf8f5fcead9fbf8faf2feebf0fdb7faf6f4ccd2>[email&nbsp;protected]</a>: +44 208 344 2007 / <a href=# class=__cf_email__ data-cfemail=f88d938b99949d8bb89a999b939f8a919cd69b9795>[email&nbsp;protected]</a>*UK Clients - Pictures Containing Children Please Pixelate Face Prior To Publication* *CLIENT RESTRICTION APPLIED*<ul><li>After two years, the singer Sam Smith has a new boyfriend!</li><li>The new man in his life now is François Rocci.</li><li>The two were spotted in Northern London on Tuesday 25 August 2020 probably on a date.</li><li>They also shared a kiss on this occasion which was caught by the cameras.</li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Sam_Smith%E2%80%99s_new_boyfriend></span>Sam Smith’s new boyfriend<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Gay non-binary singer <a href=#>Sam Smith</a>, 29 was single until now since 2018.
