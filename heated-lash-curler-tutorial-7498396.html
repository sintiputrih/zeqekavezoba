But if your <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>best volumizing mascara</a> is no longer cutting it — and you don't want to fake it with <a href=# class=pseudoStyle data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>false lashes</a> or extensions — then it's time to consider the heated lash curler.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A heated lash curler is exactly what it sounds like: The makeup tool is a lash curler that emits heat, offering lasting curl and a fuller look. However, if the idea of applying heat so close to the eye sounds intimidating, or you've just never encountered one of these gadgets, you're not alone. With that in mind, experts share the scoop on how to use a heated lash curler safely — and for the best possible results.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-does-a-heated-lash-curler-work></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How Does A Heated Lash Curler Work?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Think of it as a curling iron for your lashes instead of your hair," says celebrity makeup artist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Christin Zito Cook</a>. "Unlike traditional lash curlers, which crimp your hair and can damage and pull your eyelashes, a heated lash curler can add more intense volume and lift, as well as keeping your lashes safe."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Plus, they're not just for your natural lashes. “I love using heated lash curlers to style false lashes for my clients," adds celebrity makeup artist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Sean Harris</a>. "They help to create a seamless curl that helps them blend into your lashes.” More realistic-looking falsies? Sign us up.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A heated lash curler is perfect for those who have very straight lashes that don't curl easily, says Cook; as with the hair on your head, adding just a little bit of heat can add more volume, lift, and definition. And for maximum volume, she suggests using a traditional curler before using a heated one.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-are-they-safe></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Are They Safe?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Heated lash curlers are completely safe, so long as you use the right temperature and if you use them in moderation. Also, Cook says, be sure to clean it often before using. If you accidentally burn your skin or start noticing breakage on your lashes, it's a sign that you're using too much heat and should cut down on using it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Also, consider the temperature setting. Cook says that most curlers will have one set temperature that brands have deemed safe, while others will have multiple options to choose from. (<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Lashify's Lashicurl</a> has three settings, for instance, while <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Grande Cosmetics GrandeLASH-LIFT Heated Lash Curler</a> has two.) New York City-based board-certified dermatologist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3>Hadley King</a> is a fan of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4>Chella's Heated Eyelash&nbsp;Curler</a>, since it's easy to use and distributes heat evenly to minimize damage.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-do-you-use-a-heated-lash-curler></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How Do You Use A Heated Lash Curler?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">First, make sure you're working with clean lashes; you should only ever use a heated lash curler before applying mascara, not before. "This cannot only ruin the lash curler, but it can also make your lashes susceptible to damage," says Dr. King. "It will also make it really obvious where you used the lash curler — and where you did not."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Also important: If you can set your temperature, always start with the lowest setting and then adjust if needed, says Cook. You can also test the heat by running it over your fingertip to see how hot the lash curler is. If it's too hot for your fingertips, then it's definitely too hot for your lashes, she says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Turn on your lash curler and give it 15 to 60 seconds to heat up (the amount of time will vary according to the product). Choose your temperature setting, then hold the wand at the base of the upper lashes and slowly wiggle it up to the ends.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Apply your mascara and get ready to bat your lashes —&nbsp;easy, effective, and as effortless as it gets.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57x56YrZ2UYrmiv8dmmq6qnJq%2FbsDUraaroZGheniAmHFqcm4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogInfo - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
