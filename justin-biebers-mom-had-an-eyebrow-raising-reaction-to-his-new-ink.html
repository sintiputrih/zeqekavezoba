In fact, he even has at least <a href=#>two tattoos honoring his mother</a>. But that doesn't mean mom approves of all her son's inks. The 45-year-old also responded to her son's <a href=#>Instagram</a> share with a typical mom one-liner.&nbsp;"Don't you have enough yet?" Mallette asked before adding a weary-face emoji. It seems as if Bieber's mother just doesn't get why he continues to collect tats. Maybe she doesn't get that he may have been trying to be romantic.</p><p>Bieber may have some explaining to do because this is not the first time Mallette has seemingly poo-pooed his tats. When he got ink of a long-stemmed rose on his neck in September 2020, she reacted with "Why" and a crying-face emoji on his IG share, per <a href=#>Justin Jared Jr</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>But Mallette should find comfort because Bieba Baby has set some limits when it comes to inking himself. As he told <a href=#>SiriusXM Hits 1</a>, "I promised myself, like, I didn't want to get tattoos on my hands... Something about just being able to wear a suit and not having tattoos on my hands, I don't know," he explained. Don't worry mom, you've got that promise in black-and-white!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbG5nbYF0e8muqq2hnmKvqrHBnqmsZZ2kum60wJ1kmqZdmsamrtGormaqkZ7AqrrGZqmemZOptrC6jK2mZqCZqHqvsdZmoKejXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogInfo - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
