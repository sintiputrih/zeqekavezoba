And as per recent reports, the latest to join the long list is the absolute <a href=#>favorite</a> of game aficionados – Ghost of Tsushima – which made its debut last year. What’s even better is that Chad Stahelski, widely known for his John Wick film series, is the one who is going to helm the film adaptation.</p><p><a href=#>Deadline</a> has reported that Stahelski will not only direct the film but also produce the Ghost of Tsushima adaptation alongside Alex Young and Jason Spitz under their company 87Eleven Entertainment. Asad Qizilbash and Carter Swan will also co-produce the film under the banner of PlayStation Productions while Sucker Punch Productions, the creator of the video game, is going to be an executive producer.</p><p>“We’re excited to be partnering with Chad and 87Eleven Entertainment, to bring their vision of Jin’s story to the big screen. We love working with creative partners like Chad, who have a passion for our games, ensuring we can create rich adaptations that will excite our fans and new audiences.” Asad Qizilbash, head of PlayStation Productions, said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ghost-of-tsushima-fire-900x506.jpg><p>Sony officially confirmed that Ghost of Tsushima is being turned into a film through a statement on their <a href=#>PlayStation blog</a>.</p><p>“We are happy to partner with Sony Pictures to make this happen,” shared Nate Fox, Sucker Punch’s Game Director. “And Jin is in very good hands with the film’s director. Chad Stahelski created something special with John Wick. His vision for what could be, backed up by years of experience, combined to create some of the finest action scenes ever created. If anyone could bring to life the razor-sharp tension of Jin’s katana combat, it’s Chad Stahelski.”</p><p>Fox is indeed right as Stahelski has become something of a legend and a celebrated director since the three John Wick films, starring Keanu Reeves, became instant box office hits. Stahelski is also going to direct <a href=#>John Wick: Chapter 4</a>,&nbsp; which is yet to begin filming.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ghost-of-tsushima-2-900x572.jpg><p>As for the Ghost of Tsushima adaptation, the chances of it being a success at the box office are rather high. Not only does it have an action genre expert directing it, but the game has also been a smash hit since its release. It has been very well-received commercially as well as critically, has sold 6.5 million copies since it <a href=#>came out</a> in July 2020, and has won many awards as well as nominations.&nbsp;</p><p>The game’s core story focuses on a samurai warrior, Jin Sakai, who stands between a massive Mongol army and his homeland, the island of Tsushima, protecting it from their planned invasion. Ghost of Tsushima is a fictionalized representation of the first Mongol invasion in Japan, which took place in 1274, and depicts how Sakai, with his distinct fighting style, saves the day. There are other characters in the game that fight alongside him or against him, like a blacksmith Taka, a female warrior called Lady Masako Adachi, a thief named Yuna, famous Kyūdō archer Sensei Ishikawa, leader of the infamous Straw Hat rōnin, Ryuzo, and the ruthless antagonist, Khotun Khan of the Mongol Empire.&nbsp;</p><p>Ghost of Tsushima is the latest Playstation game that Sony will be adapting into a film soon. As of now, we already have the movie adaptation of the Uncharted game series, directed by Ruben Fleischer (Venom) and starring Tom Holland as Nathan Drake. It is set to release on February 11th, 2022.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/samurai-ghost-of-tsushima-900x506.jpg><p>It was recently announced that Sony is also picking the game, The Last of Us, &nbsp;for a TV adaptation on HBO. It is set to star The Mandalorian’s Pedro Pascal as Joel and Bella Ramsey (of Game of Thrones fame) as Ellie. Next, we have, Sony’s Metal Gear Solid that is slated to star Oscar Isaac as Solid Snake. While the announcement for Ghost of Tsushima has been made, going by Stahelski and Sony Pictures’ packed schedule, it will be a long time before the film goes into production.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Snq2ifmKTAtXnOn2Stq6Wotaq5wGakqK6ZmnupwMyl</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogInfo - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
