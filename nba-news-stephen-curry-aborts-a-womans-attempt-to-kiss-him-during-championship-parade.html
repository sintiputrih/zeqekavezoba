One female fan decided she wanted much more of Warriors hero Stephen Curry as he was on the ground posing for photos and signing autographs for supporters. Curry was greeted by the woman, who then wrapped her arm around him and tried to&nbsp;kiss&nbsp;him. Curry, a married guy, immediately withdrew after realizing what she was doing and&nbsp;Ayesha Curry was out there, but she wasn’t exactly at the moment.</p><p>The Golden State Warriors celebrated wildly at a bar in Boston after winning their fourth championship in six finals appearances since 2015. A few days later, Stephen Curry and company took a flight back to San Francisco to celebrate this amazing accomplishment with their supporters. To put it mildly, the 2022 championship parade was chaotic. Klay Thompson was out there knocking down fans, Draymond Green was abusing on national television, and Jordan Poole pulled out a water gun and a random woman came very close to kissing Curry.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Stephen Curry deserves the kiss or even more.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/firstsportz.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Adobe_Express_20220622_1451070.jpg><p>Given all of his efforts in leading Golden State back to the top of the&nbsp;NBA, it seems reasonable to&nbsp;kiss Stephen Curry.&nbsp;The Warriors’ star is married and if&nbsp;the kiss carried through, Ayesha Curry would have&nbsp;probably attacked&nbsp;the lady and Steph as well. Given that it most likely arose out of love, Steph most likely let it slip. As strange as that may sound, it really did happen. During the march, a female devotee managed to grab Curry by the neck at one point and make the most of the opportunity. The MVP of the 2022 Finals resisted her advances as she leaned in for a kiss.</p><p>The 2022 Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player was awarded to <a href=#>Stephen Curry</a> in which this is the first time he has received this honor in addition to two Kia MVP trophies from the regular season. After averaging 31.2 points, 6.0 rebounds, and 5.0 assists per game in the series, Golden State’s top player was chosen unanimously.&nbsp;Curry scored at least 30 points in three straight games in Boston’s TD Garden after finishing Thursday’s Game 6&nbsp;game with 34 points, seven assists, and seven rebounds.</p><p><strong>Also Read:</strong> <a href=#>“Charles Barkley would be hoping to steal that” Klay Thompson carelessly…</a></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>After missing all nine of his 3-point attempts in Game 5 and 15 of his 22 total shots, Stephen Curry put on a strong comeback performance on Thursday. The Warriors nevertheless triumphed 104-94, demonstrating their strength in depth and defense, giving themselves two opportunities to win the championship.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>The Warriors came back strongly after being immediately outscored by a 14-2 Boston surge, defeating the Celtics by 27 points for the remainder of the first half to take a dominating advantage that would never drop below eight the rest of the game.</p><p><strong>Also Read:</strong> <a href=#>“As always, F*ck everyone else” Draymond Green sounds off on haters…</a></p><p><strong>Also Read:</strong> <a href=#>“LeBron James was the dynasty!”Nick Wright whole heartedly defends LeBron James…</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiemafAtb%2FPqKmtsl6YvK57zZuYZqaVrMBuv9Oep6GdnmKwtr7RsmSamp%2BnwbR5wGauqKWRo8BurdOtnKaopGLBsHnKoqqsZZieum6w1Kugp59dmLWiuc%2BipqermJ69brzAq5idnV8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogInfo - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
