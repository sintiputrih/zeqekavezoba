Rewinding the details, Jackson said, "And so, they both look at each other, and the dad was like, ‘Why are you checking my child out? Who are you?'" "And he was like, ‘Who are you? What do you mean? I’m her dad,'" the other responded.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">DailyMail,</a> Jackson, who works in the school’s front office, said both men claimed and argued that the girl was their daughter. Jackson added that both of the fathers were listed as emergency contacts for the girl and that their IDs had been checked. Upon realizing that the men were about to fight, she called the principal of the school. "I and the secretary looked at each other, and I thought, I gotta get the principal right now because, at this point we need the principal. We need someone to call the school officer.

Jackson said, "When she got to the school, you know, one of the daddies ran in the parking lot to her. Like, ‘What’s going on? What's going on? Why you didn't tell me?' So, we ran out in the parking lot with them. You all how about he hit her. He hit the mama."&nbsp;</p><p>As per the outlet, Jackson said that the mother told both men that they were the father of the girl, who was not present during the alleged incident. "Nobody ever knew anything.... This was crazy. But, at the end of the day, the police [were] there. One of the daddies got locked up. You know, mama went to the EMS. Grandma had to come get the child, because nobody could get the child at that point," she said and added, "But, it was a mess.... It was a mess." Talking further, Jackson followed up with the mother, who said that her best friend was responsible for getting the two fathers together at the same time. In addition to this, she also revealed that she didn't tell her daughter about the two men.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRorKekeqixzqueopldorKvecCrqaKulWLBsHnPopqkZaWleqWt1KCfrZ2iYrOzu8xmqpygn6S5brLIp5tmp6WperStzJ5koKGioXq0tMSepZplmpawrL%2FOp2StoZupvKw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogInfo - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
