As the lowest-grossing and worst-reviewed Wizarding World movie ever made, the pressure increased exponentially on the next installment, which has been through some troubles of its own.</p><p data-characters=316 data-current-count=633 data-injectable=true>As well as dealing with the pandemic, The Secrets of Dumbledore binned Johnny Depp in favor of Mads Mikkelsen, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">which ignited an online firestorm</a>. The finished product is finally coming to theaters in April, and we’re very curious to see if Fantastic Beasts as a whole is going to sink or swim in the aftermath.</p><p data-characters=223 data-current-count=223 data-injectable=false>Somewhat surprisingly, veteran franchise producer David Heyman revealed during a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Warner Bros.</a> event that the writing process for the fourth film hasn’t even been started yet, but he did tease a potential new location.</p><p>“Well, we haven’t yet started writing the next film. So we’ll have to see. If I have my way, we’ll definitely be going to Japan.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/FHEPSM5XwAEmWQ-.jpg><p data-characters=367 data-current-count=743 data-injectable=false>The most pertinent question is whether or not anyone will care by the time the dust settles on The Secrets of Dumbledore, which has to be viewed as perhaps the most pivotal entry in the entire Wizarding World saga to date. If it’s a hit with critics and audiences then the fans and WB can breathe a sigh of relief, but questions will be asked if it isn’t.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJonZqmpJbAtbXCZpmemaOpwG6AjJ2mnqueqXqmwsSnZKGZppp6onnSnKmiqKRixqbAjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogInfo - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
