We more than likely wouldn’t be able to take the <b>battery</b> from the <b>iPhone 6</b> and put it in the Xs because of compatibility and size differences. I hope this helps. If you have anymore questions, I’d recommend speaking with your local <b>Best Buy’s Geek Squad</b>.<h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=can-battery-be-replaced-in-iphone-6></span>Can battery be replaced in iPhone 6?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3>You should <b>replace</b> your <b>iPhone 6 battery</b><p>Apple is now <b>replacing batteries</b> on <b>iPhone 6</b> smartphones or later models for $29.

Long story short, Apple has admitted that your <b>iPhone</b> will actively slow itself down if it has an old, degraded <b>battery</b>. To get back that lost performance, though, users are recommended to <b>replace</b> the <b>battery</b> with a fresh, new one.<h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-big-is-an-iphone-6-battery></span>How big is an iPhone 6 battery?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><b>Batteries</b>. The <b>iPhone 6</b> features a 6.91 Wh (1810 mAh) <b>battery</b>, while the <b>iPhone 6</b> Plus features an 11.1 Wh (2915 mAh) <b>battery</b>, neither of which are user-replaceable.<h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-do-i-update-my-iphone-6-to-ios-13></span>How do I update my iPhone 6 to iOS 13?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3>To <b>update</b> your device, make sure your <b>iPhone</b> or iPod is plugged in, so it doesn’t run out of power midway through. Next, go to the Settings app, scroll down to General and tap Software <b>Update</b>. From there, your phone will automatically search for the latest <b>update</b>.<h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-iphone-6-still-supported></span>Is iPhone 6 still supported?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3>Apple maintains <b>support</b> for older devices for several years after their release. The last time Apple culled the list of <b>supported</b> devices was with its iOS 13 update, which nixed <b>support</b> for the <b>iPhone 6</b>, <b>iPhone</b> 5s, six-generation iPod touch, the first-generation iPad Air, and third-generation iPad mini.<h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-the-iphone-6-obsolete></span>Is the iPhone 6 obsolete?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3>According to French tech site iPhoneSoft, handsets on the chopping block are the <b>iPhone 6S</b>, <b>iPhone 6S</b> Plus and original <b>iPhone</b> SE. Apple is not planning to release a version of <b>iOS</b> 15 compatible with these devices, meaning they will no longer receive vital security patches.<h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-iphone-6s-still-worth-buying-in-2020></span>Is iPhone 6s still worth buying in 2020?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3>The performance is as good as if it were brand new and 3D Touch makes this one of my favorite <b>iPhones</b> to date. But, if rumors are true, the <b>iPhone 6s</b> and the first <b>iPhone</b> SE probably won’t see a new update next year. So you really shouldn’t <b>buy</b> one in <b>2020</b>.<h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=will-iphone-6-still-work-in-2021></span>Will iPhone 6 still work in 2021?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3>So, since the <b>iPhone 6s</b> came into the market in 2015 and initially had the <b>iOS</b> 9, which was the latest at that time, it then means it <b>will</b> enjoy support up to <b>iOS</b> 14, which <b>will</b> be available in 2020. That means by <b>2021</b>; Apple <b>will</b> no longer support the <b>iPhone 6s</b>.<h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-it-worth-buying-iphone-6-plus-in-2020></span>Is it worth buying iPhone 6 Plus in 2020?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3>The <b>iPhone 6</b> is not a bad phone in <b>2020</b> if you are an extremely light user or you just need a second smartphone for basic tasks. It has the latest <b>iOS</b> 13 software update, meaning it’ll do everything what a modern <b>iPhone</b> should without any compromises.<h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-much-is-an-iphone-6-worth-now></span>How much is an iPhone 6 worth now?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3>With these factors in mind, an <b>iPhone 6</b> is <b>worth</b> between $8 and $45, an <b>iPhone 6</b> Plus is <b>worth</b> between $9 and $90, an <b>iPhone 6s</b> is <b>worth</b> between $12 and $77, and an <b>iPhone 6s</b> Plus is <b>worth</b> between $27 and $110.<h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-a-iphone-6-plus-waterproof></span>Is a iPhone 6 plus waterproof?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3>The bottom line is that Apple didn’t highlight waterproofing as a new feature because the <b>iPhone 6s</b> and <b>iPhone 6s Plus</b> aren’t <b>waterproof</b>. They may be mildly <b>water resistant</b>, and may be able to survive a speedy dunk, if King Neptune gets a proper grip on your shiny new handset, it’s history.<h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=can-iphone-6-survive-water></span>Can iPhone 6 survive water?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3>Although Apple might still be at least a generation away from a waterproof smartphone, warranty service provider SquareTrade has found that the <b>iPhone 6</b> and <b>6</b> Plus could actually <b>survive</b> for at least a short amount of time when fully submerged in <b>water</b>.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DAxJyfaKCfrHq1u46hprBlpKR6sLzEp2SiqJiku6Z5lWg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogInfo - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
