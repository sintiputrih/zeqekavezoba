I think my face represents who I am. I like it.”</p><p>It’s a sentiment that married mom of four Amanda Hanson strongly echoes.&nbsp;</p><p>“We shouldn’t be afraid of aging,” Hanson, 50, a clinical psychologist from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, told The Post. “It’s a natural process just like being born.”</p><p>Online, she passionately promotes natural beauty and has vowed to never undergo “anti-aging” <a href=#>procedures such as Botox</a>, face-lifts or fillers.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Amanda Hanson, 50, proudly refrains from wearing makeup, following a skincare routine and dying her hair in order to appear younger than her years. <span class=credit>Diana De Lange</span></figure><p>“Getting older is a beautiful spiritual journey,” she said. “I won’t dishonor the process of aging by <a href=#>trying to alter it</a> with surgery or cover it up with makeup.”</p><p>In 2013, shortly after her 40th birthday, she looked in the mirror and <a href=#>noticed</a>&nbsp;fine lines around her eyes and mouth, as well as wrinkles on her forehead. Her cheeks weren’t as full and firm as they once were.</p><p>She decided not to fight it.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">At age 40, Hanson first notice the signs of aging on her face, but decided to embrace the subtle wrinkles and lines rather than erase them with makeup or surgery. <span class=credit>Diana De Lange</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Although she’s been married for 28 years, Hanson says men regularly compliment her natural beauty. <span class=credit>Diana De Lange</span></figure><p>“I made an outward declaration to myself that I would <a href=#>never get Botox</a> or any of the treatments that toxic beauty culture says women need in order to be considered relevant, loved or chosen,” said Hanson.</p><p>Five years ago, she even stopped dyeing her gray hair — the one beauty ritual she struggled to give up.</p><p>“I was like, ‘Wait a minute Amanda, there’s still an aspect in which you are still complicit to a system that says aging is wrong or needs to be hidden,'” she added.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">During a recent sit down with “60 Minutes Australia,” Bateman acknowledged social media critics who said she “looks old.” <span class=credit>60 Minutes Australia</span></figure><p>Hanson’s pro-aging sentiments are in line not just with Bateman, but a number of mature women in Hollywood.</p><p>Paulina Porizkova, 57; Meryl Streep, 73; Drew Barrymore, 48; and <a href=#>Andie MacDowell, 64</a>, have all publicly said that they don’t want to be <a href=#>pricked by syringes</a> or <a href=#>go under the knife</a> in an attempt to look more youthful.</p><p>But such women seem to be dwindling in numbers.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Sports Illustrated super model Paulina Porizkova addressed her decision to allow her face to age sans medical intervention. <span class=credit>@paulinaporizkov/Instagram</span></figure><p>A recent survey conducted by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons found that procedures such as Botox, soft tissue filler and nonsurgical skin tightening <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">were on the rise</a> for women around the age of 45 in 2022.</p><p>The research also showed that business at 30% of clinics had at least doubled since March 2020. More than 75% of clinics said business was growing some amount.</p><p>Hanson, meanwhile, has taken her low-maintenance ethos to the nth degree. She doesn’t follow a skin care regimen — or even wash her face at night.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">In 2021, Barrymore, 47, said she doesn’t want to negatively influence her two young daughters by undergoing cosmetic surgery on her face. <span class=credit>@drewbarrymore/instagram</span></figure><p>“All I do is moisturize with a <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" data-nyp-affiliate=true>vitamin C cream</a> from Whole Foods,” she said, referring to an Andalou Naturals salve. “My face is the least interesting thing about me.”&nbsp;</p><p>On TikTok and Instagram, she’s billed herself “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Midlife Muse</a>” and has attracted more than half a million followers.</p><p>As a psychologist, she counsels clients, many of whom are in midlife, to accept and appreciate their aging faces and bodies — and to unfollow social media accounts that make them feel negative about getting older.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">In 2009, Streep, 73, told Vanity Fair that plastic surgery feels like an “interruption in communication” between her and loved ones who’ve gone under the knife. <span class=credit>Andrew H. Walker/Shutterstock</span></figure><p>Hanson has been married for nearly three decades and says that her husband, Bryan, has embraced her approach to beauty.</p><p>“He loves the fact that I’m so free. He always says he’s never been with someone so natural before,” she said.</p><p>Other men have also been drawn to her gray hair and lines visage.</p><p>“Male friends and guys on the street are constantly coming up to me telling me how great I look,” she said.</p><p>“We’re told that a young-looking woman is what men want, but that’s not true. That’s what we’ve been sold because it makes us open up our wallets to cosmetic surgeons.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j2xma3Ffn8K0wMinnGaakamyrq3NZqearZyeu6J5z6iporKbpMOiedKpmKujXZa7tbWMm6atp6hiwbOxzZ1m</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogInfo - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
