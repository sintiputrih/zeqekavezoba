Three players, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Angel Reese</a>, Caitlin Clark and Flau’jae Johnson, gained massive social media attention throughout the men’s and women’s tournaments.</p><p>Reese, who played forward for the <strong>LSU Tigers</strong>, entered the tournament with 447,000 followers on Instagram, but her count escalated significantly during March Madness, with her gaining over 650,000 followers. Eventually, she ended up with more than 1.08 million followers, and her NIL value increased to $876,000. Johnson, who played guard for the Tigers, had 884,000 followers at the start of the Final Four, but she also surpassed the one-million-follower mark during the tournament.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>Reese and Johnson’s popularity on social media is a testament to the power of their play on the court and their personalities off of it. Reese’s message to young girls to be themselves and never back down has resonated with many, and her impact on young girls has been immense. Meanwhile, Johnson’s electric style of play has made her a fan favorite, and her engaging personality on social media has only added to her appeal.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>The Final Four weekend has not only boosted the social media followings of Reese and Johnson, but also that of <strong>Iowa’s </strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Caitlin Clark</a>. Her Instagram followers more than doubled from 230,000 to 537,000, thanks to her exceptional performance on the court, which has elevated her to a rising star status in women’s basketball. Clark’s impact on the game has been notable both on and off the court.</p><p><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“We’ll go to the Obamas!” Angel Reese SPARKS a huge controversy by rejecting First Lady Jill Biden’s apology</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-women-s-basketball-continues-to-grow-in-popularity>Women’s basketball continues to grow in popularity</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/firstsportz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Adobe_Express_20230403_1040030_1-1024x768.jpg><p>The rise of Reese, Johnson, and Clark on social media is indicative of a larger trend: the growing popularity of women’s basketball. While the men’s tournament is still the more popular of the two, the women’s tournament is gaining ground. The packed bars in Iowa City during the Final Four, screaming about women’s basketball, show that the game is gaining fans and making an impact.</p><p>The NCAA’s decision to allow players to profit off their name, image, and likeness (NIL) has also helped to grow the game. The increased exposure that players like Reese, Johnson, and Clark are receiving on social media is leading to more fans tuning in to watch them play. This exposure is also leading to more opportunities for players to profit off their NIL, as companies are eager to work with the rising stars of women’s basketball.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Overall, the women’s NCAA Tournament Final Four was a success both on and off the court. The rise of social media stars like Reese, Johnson, and Clark shows that the game of women’s basketball is growing in popularity, and the future looks bright for the sport. As more and more young girls see players like Reese, Johnson, and Clark succeed, they will be inspired to pursue their own dreams and be themselves, just as Reese advises. The game of women’s basketball is on the rise, and these social media stars are leading the way.</p><p><strong>In case you missed it:</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiemafAtb%2FPqKmtsl6YvK57wZqqpJ2kl66tuIynnLCrXZa7qLHLZqmenaOaeq%2Bx02auqKqknXq0t9irppyjlanAbq3SZqOsrV2owaK%2BjJ2mrpqcmsButc2sq5qfopa6brLOpaOor5WnwG6txa2cq2WklsKvwMinnmabkZ7BrbXNZpqlmaKgeqK6w2auoqaenruoec2aq6Knnpa5bsDIraOeZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogInfo - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
