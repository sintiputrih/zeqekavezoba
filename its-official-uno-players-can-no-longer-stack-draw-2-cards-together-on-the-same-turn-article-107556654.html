Pic Credit: Pinterest</p><p>Never in the history of UNO has any game night ever been peaceful. The card game with a bunch of simple rules took the world by storm and now no round ever gets finished without a debate on stacking Draw 2 or Draw 4 cards to reap the satisfaction of the next player adding more cards to their pile. Social media is filled with numerous tweets and posts of confused players raising numerous questions such as drawing +2 and +4 cards on the same turn to let the next player draw 6 cards, and so on.</p><p>Almost every year, a discussion on the rules emerges online, after which the company has no choice but to step up and clarify the issues repeatedly. The chaos and confusion surrounding the game have caused many to make rules of their own while playing with their friends or family members.</p><p>UNO, as usual, had to step up to address the stacking issue. On September 28, 2022, the card game company put up a tweet that said, ''The rumours are true. You cannot officially stack a Draw 2 on a Draw 2.'' The single tweet was enough to stir the pot once again as users flooded the page with more questions and some hilarious remarks.</p><p>A user wrote, ''We put draw 2 on draw 4 and punish the next person, also change the colour of the next card, It's not just your game anymore.'' Another user asked, ''How about stacking a Draw 4 on a Draw 2 or Draw 2 on Draw 4?'' to which the company replied, ''Normally stacking is not allowed in the standard version, but set your own house rules!"</p><p>A user asked whether they were allowed to win the game by choosing the colour of the next card, to which they replied, ''Yes you can win with a Wild card.''</p><p>An X user wrote, ''Y'all might as well not even include directions in the card pack, we not following those!"</p><p>Addressing the most employed tactic used by players in the game, i.e. stacking +2 on top of a +4 card to make the other person pick 6 cards.</p><p>This too, brought a series of questions and statements regarding the ever-changing rules of the game. The company said a big NO to the possibility of stacking two +4 cards on top of each other as well.</p><p>In 2020, UNO had once again clarified the rule of stacking two +2 cards on top of each other. To which all the desi users responded with ''Our rules are our rules it's none of your rules.''</p><p>While the rules may never be clear for its players, one thing certainly is, and that is, even the creators of the card game cannot make rules anymore! After all, where is the fun in playing by the rules when you can always engage in countless debates and come up with a few of your own?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbXMnqqnp6ejsri%2FjZympmecnrOmv9Oyo55noJa%2FprrToqWgZ6Sasq97yK2qZqeWm7aktcClZK6mn2K9ra3YnqmsZZOWu266zmajqKaXmr9uv9OamqRllKeuuHmRZpqaqpSoerW7xp6roZ2iYryvedOhnGarkaKybsDUq6VmmaKptqS4xGZoaW9laoN3gZM%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogInfo - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
