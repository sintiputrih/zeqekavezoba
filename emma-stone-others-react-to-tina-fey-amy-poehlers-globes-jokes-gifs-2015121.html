As the hosts of the 2015 Golden Globes on Sunday, Jan. 11, <strong><a href=#>Tina Fey</a></strong> and <strong><a href=#>Amy Poehler</a></strong> showed no mercy in their opening monologue. The three-time emcees and longtime BFFs took aim at everyone from <strong><a href=#>George Clooney</a></strong> to <strong><a href=#>Meryl Streep</a></strong> to <strong>Wes Anderson</strong>, even eliciting a few gasps with their timely quips about <strong>Bill Cosby</strong>‘s ongoing sexual assault scandal.</p><p>Almost as entertaining as their jokes about the celebs were the reactions of the celebs themselves, who proved to have a pretty good sense of humor. Among our favorites? The large peeper’d <strong><a href=#>Emma Stone</a></strong>, who rolled her eyes good-naturedly when the Saturday Night Live alums compared her to one of the “cute but creepy” paintings in the Margaret Keane biopic Big Eyes, starring <strong><a href=#>Amy Adams</a></strong> and <strong>Christoph Waltz</strong>.</p><p>Of course, Stone wasn’t the only target on Sunday night. Check out some of the other best reactions below!</p><p>PHOTOS: The best moments from the 2015 Golden Globes</p><p><strong>George Clooney and Amal Alamuddin</strong></p><p>After getting burned for his then-womanizing ways at last year’s Globes, the Monuments Men actor and Cecil B. DeMille Award recipient was again targeted by Fey and Poehler in their opening monologue — this time with regards to his beautiful, smart, and worldly wife.</p><p>“George Clooney married Amal Alamuddin this year,” Fey began. “Amal is a human rights lawyer who worked on the Enron case, was an adviser to Kofi Annan regarding Syria, and was selected for a three-person U.N. commission investigating rules of war violations in the Gaza strip. So tonight, her husband is getting a lifetime achievement award!”</p><p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all" alt='George and Amal laughing at Tina&#39;s "lifetime achievement award" joke' width=467 height=263 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>PHOTOS: What the stars wore to the 2015 Globes</p><p><strong>Colin Firth</strong></p><p>During a particularly hilarious game of “Would You Rather,” Fey asked Poehler to choose between two Colins in Hollywood: <a href=#><strong>Firth</strong></a> and <strong><a href=#>Farrell</a></strong>. The Parks and Recreation star chose “Farrell, all day,” while Fey preferred “Firth, for a polite amount of time.”</p><p><img decoding=async src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all" alt="Colin Firth laughing" width=467 height=263 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><strong>Richard Linklater</strong></p><p>Pitted against fellow director <strong>Alejandro Inarritu</strong> in the hosts’ game of “Would You Rather,” the Boyhood filmmaker (who ultimately took home the Best Director and Best Drama prizes) couldn’t help but laugh at Fey’s quip about a hypothetical tryst between them. While Poehler said that she’d rather hook up with Inarritu — “One take, two hours straight, no stopping” (a reference to his directing style) — Fey joked, “No, see, Linklater. Five minutes, once a year.” (The punchline was a nod to Boyhood‘s innovative filmmaking process, which took 12 years.)&nbsp;</p><p><img decoding=async src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all" alt="Richard Linklater doing a thumbs up" width=467 height=263 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>PHOTOS: Men in tuxes at the Globes</p><p><strong>Steve Carell</strong></p><p>Even Poehler had to giggle at Carell’s poker-faced reaction to her one-liner about his role in the <strong><a href=#>Channing Tatum</a></strong> wrestling drama Foxcatcher. “In Foxcatcher, <strong><a href=#>Steve Carell</a></strong> plays a paranoid, murderous billionaire,” she began. “The role was a stretch for Carell, who in real life is a paranoid, murderous millionaire.”</p><p><img decoding=async src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all" alt="Steve Carell totally blank-faced" width=467 height=263 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>PHOTOS: The hottest Globes parties</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><strong>Joaquin Phoenix</strong></p><p>The famously eccentric actor gave a hearty greeting to the hosts when they called him out for his history of scorning awards shows. “Joaquin Phoenix is nominated for Inherent Vice,” Fey said, “but obviously he isn’t here tonight, because he has said publicly that awards shows are, quote, total and utter bullsh…Oh, hey, Joaquin!”</p><p><img decoding=async src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all" alt="Joaquin Phoenix waving" width=467 height=263 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJympZFiwLW7zZ5kqKyYmr%2B0edGemJysXam8bsDIp5hmnpWueqK52GanqJ2YobKzv4ygo6ialah6q7vKnqpmn5mbwG5%2Bj2psamphZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogInfo - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
