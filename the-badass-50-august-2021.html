While I didn't expect that prominence to fall to me so suddenly, I've long believed in the public calling and necessity of poets. To me, they've always been the rock stars of civilization.

Her latest project, Hot White Heist, is a queer action-comedy for Audible. "I actually don't think about how far we have all come in terms of visibility in race and queerness, but then again it isn't that hard to remember how invisible we were," says Cho of her tenure in the entertainment world. "It is also weird to think that this might only be temporary, and that things might completely change. I really hope we don't go backward.

With the click of a button on their designs, someone in an unsafe or uncomfortable situation can discreetly alert designated contacts, connect with police, or send themselves an incoming call as an exit excuse.

Anita Hill</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The lawyer and professor has been fighting workplace harassment for three decades, and she won't stop until she's won.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">At a historic Senate hearing in 1991, Hill testified that her former supervisor, then–Supreme Court justice nominee Clarence Thomas, had sexually harassed her while she was his assistant at the U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights and U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Taking the stand that day ultimately shaped the mission of her life's work. "I wish I'd known I was going to be in this for the long haul," says Hill. "Then I wouldn't have been discouraged when things didn't happen quickly or the way I wanted." In 2017, she was tapped to serve on the Global Leadership Board of Time's Up as chair of the Hollywood Commission for Eliminating Sexual Harassment and Advancing Equality. "It's the most daunting challenge I've faced of late, because the problems are so deeply rooted," says Hill. "It really is like boiling the ocean."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">With the hope that lasting change is possible through education, she currently teaches courses on gender, race, social policy, and legal history at Brandeis University. "I want every student to leave my class with the tools to understand what it's like to be in the margins and to center those voices," says Hill, whose third book, <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Believing: Our Thirty-Year Journey to End Gender Violence</a>, will be published by Viking in September. "A few years ago I started looking at issues of gender violence — not just sexual harassment in terms of what happened to me, but stories I've heard from others who have identified with my situation, and there were so many similarities," she says. "This has been a public crisis long before the #MeToo movement, and people are still facing resistance to their ideas or identities in the workplace and can't come forward. As long as those conditions exist, I will be doing this work."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Creating real impact takes time, Hill has learned. "When I first graduated from law school, I thought the journey to change the world would be a sprint," she says. "After 20 years, I thought it was more of a marathon. Now I've realized it's a relay: Each generation does what they can, and some do more than those who came before them. But at some point, we're going to have to pass the baton. And I hope my generation leaves the world a better place than what we came into."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Ben Rothstein/Warner Bros.; Courtesy Phoebe Robinson; Voto Latino; Dan Ahn; Courtesy Mary Pryor</span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-6-lisa-joy></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>6.

But long before she was writing prestige sci-fi scripts, the Harvard Law grad spent her time writing briefs. She worked as a consultant by day and spent her nights screenwriting until she landed a staff writer job on ABC's Pushing Daisies in 2007. For Joy, the never-ending hustle was worth it.

But perhaps her most meaningful project to date is the upcoming launch of her own imprint, Tiny Reparations Books, which is dedicated to making publishing more diverse. "Like most industries, if you're not a cis, straight white guy, it can be a struggle to get your art out to the masses," says Robinson. "The point of the imprint is to help broaden the landscape so that more women, POCs, and folks from the LGBTQIA+ community can share their work the way they want to.
