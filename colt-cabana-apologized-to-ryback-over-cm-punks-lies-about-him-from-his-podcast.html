That being said, even though he may have dragged his friends in some situations, that doesn’t mean they 100% had his back.</p><p>CM Punk and Colt Cabana used to be very close. In fact, their resurfaced story about<a href=#> “bikini girl” went viral in the wrong way in recent memory. </a>CM Punk appeared on Cabana’s Art of Wrestling podcast, and he dropped an interview that got both of them sued by WWE’s doctor Chris Amann, a lawsuit that they would go on to win, but it took its toll.</p><p>Ryback spoke about CM Punk <a href=#>on his recent live stream.</a> He had a lot to say about CM Punk’s manipulative ways. He then went on to address Colt Cabana as he revealed that he has no issues with him. In fact, Cabana apologized for what Punk said about him in that podcast.</p><p>“Colt Cabana saw me at an event, and he came up and apologized to me. He just apologized for what Punk said about me on his podcast and made up the lies on me. He came up to me and apologized to me that that ever happened.”</p><p>CM Punk made claims that Ryback was a stiff worker, and it took “years” off his career to wrestle him.
