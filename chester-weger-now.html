On March 14, the trio arrived and took an afternoon hike through St. Louis Canyon, but they never returned to the Starved Rock Lodge.</p><p>Two days later, Frances Murphy’s husband called the lodge to ask about his wife. Once he and management of the inn learned of her disappearance, the police organized a search of the park. Sadly, they discovered the bodies of the three women, tied with rope and partially nude, inside of a cave in the canyon. All three women sustained severe head trauma due to repeated strikes with a thick, frozen tree branch.</p><p>As suspects started rolling in, a then 21-year-old <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chester Weger</a> was among those questioned. Several Starved Rock Lodge employees reported that Weger, a dishwasher at the hotel, arrived to work with scratches on his face the day after the three women disappeared.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: HBO</span></figure><p>Weger was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">questioned extensively</a> and given three lie detector tests, all of which he passed. However, authorities were not going to let Weger off the hook due to his sketchy past, and on March 3, 1961, he was found guilty of the murder of only one of the slain women: Lillian Oetting.</p><p>Six decades and one upcoming docuseries later, many are curious to know about the current whereabouts of Weger. Where is he, and what is he doing now?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: HBO</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Where is Chester Weger now?</h2><p>For the last 60 years, Weger constantly proclaimed his innocence in prison. He repeatedly sought parole, but the board denied Weger's attempts. However, in November 2019, the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chicago Tribune</a> declared that Illinois Prisoner Review Board granted his release after 59 years in jail with a 9-to-4 vote.</p><p>In October 2021, the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chicago Sun-Times</a> reported that 82-year-old Weger "won court approval to test evidence found at the scene of the 1960 murders in his effort to prove his innocence."</p><p>Weger still claims his innocence, and with the examination of cigarette butts, hair, and string, his attorney said, "DNA testing on hairs found on the victims could rule out Weger as the killer. If that were to happen, Weger could seek to have his conviction vacated."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: HBO</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">HBO is producing a three-part docuseries about the triple murder called 'The Murders at Starved Rock.'</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Murders at Starved Rock</a> is an upcoming three-part docuseries that examines the vicious triple murder of the three women at Starved Rock State Park in 1960.
