So if Mom comes home then obviously it’ll be she and Chloe, or if Mom and Dad both come home then I would most certainly go back to school and try to become a lawyer. It’s never too late to follow your dreams. If I could be a lawyer by the time I’m 30 or 32, I might just do it.”</p><p>Todd, 54, and Julie, 51, were first indicted in 2019 on charges of tax evasion, bank and wire fraud and conspiracy. After a lengthy trial, the<a href=#><i> Chrisley Knows Best</i>&nbsp;</a>couple were found guilty in June 2022. Nearly six months later, the real estate mogul was sentenced to 12 years in prison while his wife received a seven-year sentence. The couple&nbsp;<a id=OWAc5a5bde9-c733-a5e1-2bc5-215eed0e7314 class=x_OWAAutoLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-auth=NotApplicable data-loopstyle=linkonly data-linkindex=1>has maintained their innocence</a>.</p><p>The duo <a href=#>reported for their</a> respective prison sentences in January, 2023. Todd began serving his sentence at FPC Pensacola, a minimum security facility in Florida, while Julie started serving her time at Federal Medical Center in Lexington, Kentucky. In 2023, their sentences were reduced, with Todd now serving 10 years, while Julie will serve 5.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I think that that’s why I’m in a better place with it, because I know that this is not my final destination,” Todd said during a prerecorded January episode of “Chrisley Confessions” podcast, which was posted after he arrived in prison. “I know that this may be my future for a minute, but I also have faith that the judicial system is going to turn it around. I also have faith that the appellate court is going to see this for what it is.”</p><p>Savannah’s <a href=#>passion for advocacy</a> sparked shortly after seeing her parents behind bars. “Why do we continue to fail people? It tears families apart,” she said on her “Unlocked” podcast in November 2022. “Look at everything that we’re going through. How is that just? It’s not when you’ve got rapists and murderers and traffickers and all these people out here but yet, what? They just get a slap on the wrist.”</p><p>She continued: “It all goes down to us being in the public eye and someone wanting to prove a point. And it’s honestly sad. At this point, I feel like, for me, I’ve kinda become numb to it but that numbness has turned to anger, to where now, it’s just like I’m not giving up.&nbsp;There’s no other option.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGasmaaWu6%2Btx2aaoaqZqLmmxYywmKeso2LBsLDDZqGupJmaeqS00aKqpZ2pYry2wIyonWaoop7AsLqMm7Bmq6Wiuqa%2Bjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogInfo - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
