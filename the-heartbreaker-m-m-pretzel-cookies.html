This holiday is not all about overpriced roses and trying to manage expectations. ðŸ™‚ My Mom was the greatest at making us feel incredibly special every single Valentineâ€™s Day. The funny thing is that I called her a few hours ago as she was getting ready to board a plane to see her grandchildren in Utah. &nbsp;Even though she was rushing to leave town, she told me that she had made a Valentineâ€™s Day box filled with frosted sugar cookies for my kids. Always thinking of others!</p><p>Since this holiday is all about chocolate and roses, I wanted to create a cookie that was salty and sweet. The Heartbreaker Cookie made with crunchy pretzels and chocolate M & Mâ€™s is everything a good cookie should be. &nbsp;It has the buttery crispy edges with the melt-in-your-mouth center and a little crunch to keep things interesting.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/DSC_0171-copy.jpg alt="Heartbreaker M & M Pretzel Cookies made with sweet dough, crunchy salty pretzels, and chocolate M & M's.

Cream it for at least 4 minutes until it is nice and fluffy. &nbsp;I use half baking soda and half cornstarch as I love what both of them do to create an incredible texture.</p><p>The pretzels still have a slight crunch to them even though they are mixed into the dough. &nbsp;I usually get the sticks but you can use any type of shaped hard pretzel. I keep them large enough that you can see them in the cookies. &nbsp;I add the M & Mâ€™s after I drop the Heartbreaker M &M Pretzel Cookies onto the baking sheet. It helps to make sure that the M & Mâ€™s are evenly distributed throughout the cookie. I used the XL Valentineâ€™s M & Mâ€™s but you can use whatever you please. You can even substitute chocolate chips for the M & Mâ€™s.</p><p>What are your plans for the big day? My Mom always told us that we didnâ€™t need a boyfriend to celebrate the day. &nbsp;Itâ€™s the day of LOVE to spread some love by making these Heartbreaker M & M Pretzel cookies for someone who may need a little boost.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/DSC_0196-copy.jpg alt="Since this holiday is all about chocolate and roses, I wanted to create a cookie that was salty and sweet.
