He shares kids Kevin and Katie with the costume designer. Jimmy then went on <a href=#>to date fellow comedian&nbsp;<b>Sarah Silverman</b></a>&nbsp;from 2002 to 2009.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/shutterstock_editorial_10414093cu.jpg><p class=p1><span class=s1>Like Jimmy, Molly was also in a relationship with someone else when she first met her now-husband through work as a writer’s assistant on his late-night talk show. The blonde beauty worked her way up through the ranks and is now the co-head writer on&nbsp;<i>Jimmy Kimmel Live!</i></span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Funny enough, Molly said sparks didn’t exactly fly during their first encounter. The&nbsp;<i>Boss Baby</i>&nbsp;actor insulted her when she told him she competed in triathlons.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“Jimmy looked up at me and said, ‘That is really stupid! What a waste of time,’” she told&nbsp;<i>Glamour</i>&nbsp;in 2014. “That was the first and only thing he probably said to me the entire first year of working there.”</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>They eventually formed a friendship which turned romantic in late 2009. However, Molly admitted she was extremely hesitant about dating her boss. “I remember telling Jimmy, ‘If this doesn’t work out, nothing in your life changes, but mine changes completely,’” she previously told&nbsp;<i>The Hollywood Reporter</i>.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Of course, things worked out, and they got hitched in June 2013. They welcomed their first child&nbsp;together, daughter Jane, in 2014 followed by <a href=#>son William, who goes by Billy</a>, in 2017.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Billy was born with a <a href=#>congenital heart condition</a>, and Jimmy has since become an <a href=#>advocate for children’s healthcare</a>. He has also openly spoken about the struggles he and Molly <a href=#>have gone through at home</a>.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/shutterstock_editorial_10302645bc.jpg><p class=p1><span class=s1>“Most of all, I want to thank my wife, Molly. First of all, for allowing me to have sex with her in the first place,” he <a href=#>joked during a monologue</a> on his show. “Also for being so strong and level-headed and positive and loving during the worst nightmare a new mother could experience. I couldn’t ask for a better partner. I’m so happy we had this baby together. I’m definitely getting a vasectomy after this.”</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>It looks like Jimmy and Molly make a great team!</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46wn6hlmah6q7XMprBmo5miuqa40mauop6VYrqwuMuyZKabnpqus7rEsmSiq12dtrR50p6aqKaUYsCxu9SsnGg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogInfo - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
