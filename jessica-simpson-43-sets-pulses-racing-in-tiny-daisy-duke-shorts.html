Rodeo on Rodeo." The snapshot was a beautiful blend of Jessica's Texan roots and her distinctive fashion sense.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/09a25bb3a84f-382592459183871195630151102137925848644109756n.jpg><p id=eH4ZMZYc2K3 data-wc=32>Since its inception in 2005, Jessica's brand has carved an indomitable niche for itself. Boasting over $1 billion in revenue, it stands tall as the most triumphant celebrity licensing brand in history.&nbsp;</p><p id=e5QTxuVwN0v data-wc=37>Fans might recall Jessica donning similar Daisy Duke shorts in the 2005 movie "Dukes Of Hazzard." Clearly, the style holds a special place in her heart, as evidenced by her recent fashion campaign and past cinematic roles.</p><p id=e1tG8b9FgUM data-wc=33>Beyond her business endeavors, Jessica's personal journey is nothing short of inspiring. Married to former NFL player Eric Johnson since 2014, she's a proud mother to three adorable children: Maxwell, Ace, and Birdie.&nbsp;</p><p id=e3cyUoFgLh1 data-wc=42>After Birdie's birth, Jessica undertook a remarkable transformation, shedding 100 pounds in just six months. With a dedicated meal plan, an average of 14,000 steps per day, and expert guidance from celebrity trainer Harley Pasternak, she emerged stronger, healthier, and more confident.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/1b18072c1c04-381173565183871195720151105467025270158460442n.jpg><p id=eVHm4ak0qXn data-wc=27>As she confided on Instagram: "6 months. 100 pounds down (Yes, I tipped the scales at 240)... Even when it felt impossible, I chose to work harder."&nbsp;</p><p id=e-7uNDIllr6 data-wc=21>Harley emphasized the importance of sustainability, noting that their strategy focused on a lasting lifestyle change over transient and drastic measures.</p><p id=erNipXYsat9 data-wc=36>Jessica's evolved relationship with her body and weight is evident in her refreshing outlook. In a candid conversation with Hoda Kotb on the Today Show in 2021, Jessica admitted she's relinquished the obsession with the scale.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/7a8b8cf224dc-381228826183871195810151103341062716035575096n.jpg><p id=eFSkuuHmH86 data-wc=36>"I have no idea how much I weigh," she shared. "Like, I just want to feel good and be able to zip my pants up. If I don't, I have another size. I have every size."</p><p id=et3iXsatTf3 data-wc=27>By September 2022, Jessica channeled the persistent chatter surrounding her weight fluctuations into a business strategy, using it as an impetus to launch The Jessica Simpson Collection.&nbsp;</p><p id=eDmdhyPRykP data-wc=37>Speaking to Extra, she said: "Okay, everybody is going to talk about my weight all the time, I might as well make money off of it and turn it into a business of selling clothes and acceptance."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/977a609ea626-jessica-simpson-is-barbie.jpg><p id=emT5YVb8KS1 data-wc=35>Still, the journey wasn't always easy. The consistent scrutiny about her appearance and weight took a toll on her psyche. Jessica confessed that the undue emphasis on her looks made her constantly second-guess her self-worth.</p><p id=eydamI2XfXo data-wc=26>&nbsp;"I spent so many years beating myself up for an unrealistic body standard that made me feel like a failure all of the time," she reflected.</p><p id=eer6yve_0uX data-wc=39>Yet, with time and introspection, Jessica found solace and acceptance. The current body positivity movement has resonated deeply with her, offering support and validation. Her past struggles with self-image have gradually transformed into a more wholesome and accepting perspective.&nbsp;</p><p id=eLaxfwxIP-ie data-wc=27>"I believe in my heart," Jessica mused, "that a healthy body and a sound mind-body connection are what's truly important and help me accept imperfections as beauty."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfm660tMiopWiblaGyo77IrbBmq6SuuaZ7lGlqbm5iZLemv9Kimpplo566sb%2FOp2Rta12osrW%2FjKmspauVqHqzrcKipaBlmaN6tbXNsmSdmZmoxm6w1KScZquYpL%2B1v44%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogInfo - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
