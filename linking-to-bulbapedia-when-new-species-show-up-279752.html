I'll consider doing that, though part of the problem is that some of these characters show up and start being important in the middle of a section, so I would then have to decide whether I want to show their image before or after they appear. (In an ideal world, I would be making illustrations, but I have neither the time nor talent, I'm afraid...)<p>Since this is a forum about Pokemon, assuming readers already know the Pokemon makes sense. And I don't know much about the games following XY, so nothing brand new will be showing up.</p><p>My main concern is based on my past experiences reading things here. Though I'm familiar with most of the Pokemon, there would be times were I would develop a mental image of a Pokemon that was totally wrong. Say, if I incorrectly assumed an Eevee is bipedial, then I would be confused holds something in its teeth. Maybe this is more of a personal problem, since I tend to maintain a mental image of what's going on when I read things. Maybe that's kinda weird, but... idk? <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bulbagarden.net/data:image/gif;base64 alt=:confused: title="Confused Psyduck :confused:" data-shortname=:confused: style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>On the topic of visualizing action, I absolutely agree. IMO, action needs to flow well yet be interesting. If a lot is happening at once, I'll keep descriptions brief and keep things moving. Though the story is being told in 3rd person, it's generally going to be from someone's perspective; if they don't have time to notice something, it's not getting brought up. (On that note, that's part of why I don't want to be describing Pokemon; unless the character has never seen the species before, they'd just think "Oh, it's a ____," and carry on.)</p><p>But almost all of the characters in the story are Pokemon, so they're important all of the time, not just during action scenes.</p><p>Also, I'm not referring to moves by name very often. When I do, it's not enough to just say "The Umbreon fired a shadow ball." That's just telling you what's happening, and I'd rather "show and not tell."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapaGvorPAq5uepl6jsrV706GpnpmUqHyttc2koKefXam8bq7UpZmaqJWZtqJ51qGcp2WemsRuv8%2BemqKdo2LAqbvWZqypZmJshniBkWg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogInfo - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
