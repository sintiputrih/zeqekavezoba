Unfortunately, the 13th and final episode airs on Dec. 1. Naturally, viewers are confident of another season, but that could take forever. In the meantime, these 10 anime are quite similar to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Frieren: Beyond Journey’s End</a>, and will keep any fan entertained.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-10-spice-and-wolf data-injectable=false>10. Spice and Wolf&nbsp;</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=404 data-current-count=704 data-injectable=true>Spice and Wolf follows the story of Kraft Lawrence (Spice) as he befriends a wolf Deity named Holo while he passes through a nearby town.
