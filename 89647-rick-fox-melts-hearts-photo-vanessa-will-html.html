The actor recently shared a beautiful photo of Jillian Hervey, Vanessa’s eldest daughter, on her birthday.</p><p class=Zg>Jillian Hervey, better known as one half of the Art-R&B duo Lion Babe, is the daughter of Vanessa Williams and first husband Ramon Hervey II. The gorgeous lady, whose big red mane has made her famous, recently celebrated her 29th birthday, and the whole family was ready to celebrate, including the man who was once her stepfather.</p><p class=Zg>Rick Fox married Vanessa Williams back in 1999 and they have a daughter, Sasha, who’s the youngest of Vanessa’s kids and whom her siblings adore. After being with Vanessa for five years, is only natural that the former NBA player created a space in his heart for her other kids, and he just proved that affection is still there.</p><p class=Zg>Fox shared a gorgeous photo of Jillian in order to congratulate her on her special day. In the pic, Hervey looks stunning wearing a black jacket with a black bra underneath that put her cleavage on display. As the name of her group, her lioness-like big reddish hair takes most of the shot, making her look fierce.</p><p class=Zg>“Happy Birthday #WonderWoman @lionbabe Jillian We all love you! @sashafoxyy ‘s #BigSisDewey,” Rick wrote in the caption of his post.</p><p class=Zg>Vanessa Williams also shared her respective birthday post, with an adorable throwback pic of little Jillian riding on her shoulders that she captioned:</p><p class=Zg>“Happy Birthday Jillian @lionbabe! I’m always here to lift you up through life’s journeys. Love you dearly.”</p><p class=Zg>Lion Babe has been rising on the music charts lately with their new single “Honey Dew,” and after their spectacular set on Coachella, the group has been earning a lot of attention from fans all over the world.</p><p class=Zg>The duo, formed by Jillian and music producer Lucas Goodman, started their collaboration in 2012 with the single “Treat Me Like Fire,” which earned them a record deal with Interscope Records. They have worked with Pharrell and Childish Gambino and are currently working on their second studio album.</p><p class=Zg>Jillian <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.billboard.com/articles/6386021/lion-babe-on-debut-ep>told</a> Billboard Magazine of the band’s name that:</p><p class=Zg>“With me as the frontwoman, you might think I’m Lion Babe, but it's like, no, we’re Lion Babe. We liked that. It’s about embracing your uniqueness, and rocking it.”</p><p class=Zg>Happy belated birthday to Jillian Hervey, and may success keep on knocking at her door.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jnFwb2xnYr%2Bqr8pmnaiwXaKyrcDSZp%2BemaKpwG68x6irqGWmlrumv9KaZLChnKF7qcDMpQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogInfo - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
