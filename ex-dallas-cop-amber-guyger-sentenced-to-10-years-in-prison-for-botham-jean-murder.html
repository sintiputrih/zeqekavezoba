I want the best for you because I know that’s exactly what Botham would do,” Brandt said in a victim-impact statement after the sentencing. “I don’t know if this is possible but can I give you a hug? Please?”</p><p>The defense argued that the ex-cop feared Jean was an intruder when she barged into his unlocked apartment, mistaking it for of her own pad one floor below.</p><p>“We know by the verdict that it was an unreasonable mistake, but it was still a mistake,” defense attorney Toby Shook said Wednesday in closing statements. “She didn’t go there trying to kill him. It was the last thing on her mind.”</p><p>Prosecutors, however, claimed that her defense was “absurd” and questioned how she missed the signs that she was in the wrong apartment.</p><p>Guyger faced a sentence of 5 to 99 years in prison for the murder charge. Before the guilty verdict was handed down, she elected for the jury to decide her sentence.</p><p>The prosecution asked the jury hand the fired cop no less than a 28-year sentence.</p><p>“This is not a five, 10 or 15-year case. Botham didn’t provoke his own death,” Prosector LaQuita Long said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlfnp7kGlmaWpfmsVusMClo5qrXZi8sXnAppmeql2cwrqzxKtkrJ2eqbKvr8SdZK2nXWZ9bsXEmqmsZZmjerG%2ByKymp2WWpL9urs6tn5qlXZ%2ByorqMpqyrnJWnfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogInfo - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
