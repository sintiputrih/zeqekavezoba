The pair, who are&nbsp;non-identical, are the only children of French actress Marlène Jobert and dentist Walter Green.&nbsp;</p><p id=eMqOGovKZze data-wc=1><strong>READ:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>What is Eva Green's accent in The Luminaries?</a></strong></p><p id=eeFtlYtDOCW data-wc=42>Eva previously opened up about her sister to Town and Country magazine, explaining: "We became close with age – we were too different as children. Now we really get on; we are still very different, but we kind of complete each other."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/cbe0e632ff14-eva-and-joy-green-z.jpg><p id=epT2BB5L7yc2 data-wc=8><strong>Eva with her parents and twin sister, Joy</strong></p><p id=emtE0TuMYUTu data-wc=32>She also revealed that she would regularly go to the cinema, an interest that wasn't shared by her sister. She explained: "I used to go on my own, my sister wasn’t interested."&nbsp;</p><p id=eDgLMwV8qYfJ data-wc=1><strong>READ:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Everything you need to know about BBC's The Luminaries</a></strong></p><p id=emfwUsGMm1X0 data-wc=85>In early photos of the pair, they look very much alike with blonde hair, which Eva nows dyes. She explained: "I spent five hours at the hairdresser. It’s who I am, I feel more 'me.'" Joy is a business school graduate who now lives in Italy with her husband, where they co-run a wine company. Eva told W magazine: "She's not at all in the business, she lives in Italy, she's married to an Italian count, she's blonde. She's the other me, the happy me!"&nbsp;</p><p id=eJnnk9guJ1LH data-wc=1><strong>READ:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>The Luminaries: the TV show's astrology explained</a></strong></p><p id=eLnK22SPceoa data-wc=35>Eva recently opened up about her character on Luminaries, telling Deadline: "I needed to get into the world and take an American accent, which is not natural to me. Lydia is quite smooth and nonchalant."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/6bf2b912473f-twins-eva-joy-z.jpg><p id=eqVudJ5q9neO data-wc=8><strong>Eva and Joy with their mother,&nbsp;Marlène Jobert</strong></p><p id=ehekTu2uWXyR data-wc=71>She continued: "You've got the gold rush, but it's also a world where men outnumber women and you have to be super strong as a woman — have a knife under your skirt and wish for the best. I don’t get much pleasure out of playing the girlfriend all the time. You want to do what the guys do. Especially on this show, it was physically very demanding and very exciting."&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfm7atuY5rZ2toYGx%2Bc4WSa25pZ6Sdsm641Kagp5minrK0ecSvmGafopqyr3nMnpytZZiav27A1qKlZquZqMGmvo4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogInfo - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
