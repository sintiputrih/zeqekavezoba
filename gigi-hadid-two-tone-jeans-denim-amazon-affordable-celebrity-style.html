Sure, there are different cuts like skinny, straight leg, wide leg, boyfriend, bootcut, etc., and differing details like fading or distressing, but in the end, we pretty much know what we’re getting with a jean. Until we don’t.</p><p>We have to say, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">two-tone jeans</a> took Us by surprise in the best way, and now we can’t imagine our lives without them. They’re an extreme outfit upgrade, but they take truly no more effort than wearing any other pair of jeans. One leg is a different shade of denim than the other. That’s it. And yet, it’s <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">everything</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/gigi-hadid-two-tone-jeans-italy.jpg><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">WDIRARA Two-Tone High-Waist Casual Jeans</a> starting at just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$30</a> at Amazon!

The supermodel and new mom recently rocked a pair with two different outfits in Milan, Italy. One day, she wore them with a paisley cardigan, ankle boots and a green beanie, seen above, while the next she wore them with a black button-up, an oversized blazer, UGG boots and a multicolor beanie. Sunglasses and mask were also on, of course!</p><p>Hadid’s looks were what inspired us to find <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">these Amazon jeans</a>. Her original EB Denim pair is actually $280, which is easily out of our regular denim budget, but we knew if we could find the same type of style, we’d be able to not only recreate her looks but invent a few of our own!</p><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">WDIRARA Two-Tone High-Waist Casual Jeans</a> starting at just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$30</a> at Amazon!

You simply take that photo (or grab a screenshot), upload it, and wait only a couple of seconds for Amazon to conduct a digital search. You’ll see little dots pop up on the original photo that you can click to focus on each part of the outfit that the search recognized. You’ll be presented with a slew of similar (or possibly even the same) pieces when the search is finished, all available on Amazon. It’s such a great way to find <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">a look you want for less</a>!</p><p>Now that you have both the jeans you never knew you needed and the shopping hack you probably wish you always had, we’ll send you off. Can’t wait to see you strutting the streets like they’re your runway!</p><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">WDIRARA Two-Tone High-Waist Casual Jeans</a> starting at just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$30</a> at Amazon!
