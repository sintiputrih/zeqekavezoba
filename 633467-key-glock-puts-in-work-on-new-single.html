Moreover, he got fans prepped and ready for his next album Glockoma 2, which releases next week on February 24th. Of course, Key's never been one to take too long out of the spotlight. For example, just last year he released the <a href=# rel>PRE5L</a> EP in honor of his <a href=# rel>fallen friend</a>, <a href=# class=text-word rel>Young Dolph</a>. With this newest track, he continues contributing menacing, hard-hitting, but still emotionally resonant trap music. Although this newest track is about all the work Glock puts in, he still laments some of the losses he experienced along the way.</p><p>SCOTTSDALE, ARIZONA - FEBRUARY 11: Key Glock attends Tao X Maxim Big Game Party: An unKommon events Production at Southwest Jet Center on February 11, 2023 in Scottsdale, Arizona.

For one, the haunting string and vocal samples that form its melody are atmospheric and quite distinct from your typical piano leads. While it doesn't switch up much in terms of the beat, <a href=# rel>Glock's flow</a> goes through a few changes. Also, the beat's oddity grows on you, and you notice its old-school Memphis-inspired drums the more you listen. At the center of it all, Key keeps a steady and authoritative flow as he details his perseverance.</p><p>Still, what did you think of Key Glock's newest single ahead of his next album Glockoma 2, "Work"?
