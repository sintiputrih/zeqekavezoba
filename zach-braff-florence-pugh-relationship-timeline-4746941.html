After nearly four years of dating, that’s certainly what fans think, and it’s all because of Florence’s recent trip to Ibiza, Spain. The British actress was photographed cozying up to actor <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Will Poulter</strong></a>, 29, in their swimsuits on the beach on May 23. The former&nbsp;<i>Midsimmar&nbsp;</i>co-stars seemed very comfortable with each other, but Florence took to her <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram Stories</a> to clarify that her and Will aren’t dating. “Thanks for saying we look sexy… doesn’t mean we’re doing the sexy,” she said. The&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Black Widow</a> actress did not clarify if she and Zach are still together.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>So, how did Florence and Zach meet, and what have been some of their standout moments as a couple thus far? We’re taking a look back at the pair’s years-long partnership in this relationship timeline.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Zach-Braff-Florence-Pughs-Dating-History-embed-1.jpg><h2><strong>August 2018: Zach & Florence are linked</strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-4>Zach and Florence’s romance appeared to start sometime around August 2018, which is when he began “liking” her posts on Instagram. That same month, the <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Scrubs</a>&nbsp;alum publicly praised Florence on Twitter for her performance in the film&nbsp;Lady Macbeth. “I watched an incredible film last night that I cannot stop thinking about: ‘Lady Macbeth’ starring @Florence_Pugh,” Zach <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>tweeted</a>. “Beautifully directed, shot, acted etc. It’s very upsetting, so be forewarned. Florence is a movie star.”</p><h2><strong>April 2019: Florence appears in Zach’s short film</strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-5>Seemingly after they started dating, Zach recruited Florence to star in his short film&nbsp;In The Time It Takes to Get There, which was released in April 2019. It’s possible that the project was what really ignited the flame between the stars.</p><h2><strong>November 2019: Zach & Florence make their Instagram debut</strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-6>The first time that Florence popped up on her beau’s social media was in Oct. 2019. Zach had posted a photo of a few friends, including Florence, and wrote, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>“People I love.”</a> However, the pair didn’t link up for a public photo together until the following month, when Zach <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>shared a group photo</a> from Disneyland. Florence and Zach posed next to each other in the snapshot, which Zach captioned, “Epic day at @disneyland#Disneyland #HappiestPlace.”</p><h2><strong>April 2020: Florence celebrates Zach’s birthday</strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-9>After many months of dating, Florence paid tribute to her boyfriend on Instagram in April 2020, in honor of Zach’s <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>45th birthday</a>. Sharing a photo of Zach sleeping on his dog, Florence wrote, “Today we shall smile wider than the clouds are grey. April 6th and we’re celebrating hard! Happy Birthday wishes, boogies and cheers for this special person. Raise those bubbles and jiggle!”</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>Florence’s post sparked backlash from fans who criticized the couple’s 21-year age gap. In response, Florence shot back at her haters in a <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>passionate video</a>. “I do not need you to tell me who I should and should not love, and I would never in my life ever, ever tell someone who they can and cannot love,” the <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Hawkeye</a>&nbsp;star explained.&nbsp;“It is not your place. And really it has nothing to do with you. The abuse that you throw at him is abuse that you throw at me.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>Months later, in November 2020, Zach spoke about Florence defending their relationship in an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Mr. Porter</a>. “She literally sat down, hit record on her phone and said that,” Zach recalled. “I thought: how could I possibly follow anything as intelligent and articulate as that? So, I chose not to.”</p><h2><strong>March 2021: Florence & Zach spark marriage rumors</strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-14>Florence and Zach had fans believing they got married as they took a stroll with their dog&nbsp;<strong>Billie&nbsp;</strong>around L.A. in March 2021. Zach sported a band on his left hand, but Florence had no ring on. The <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>marriage speculation</a> had actually started in January 2021, when <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Cosmopolitan</a> noted that a friend referred to Florence as “FPB,” which many interpreted as meaning “Florence Pugh-Braff.” As it turns out, Florence and Zach never got married.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Zach-Braff-Florence-Pughs-Dating-History-embed-2.jpg><h2><strong>July 2021: Florence defends her relationship with Zach</strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-15>Once again, Florence was forced to speak out to defend her and Zach’s relationship. “I&nbsp;think it bugs people that it’s not who they expected,” she told the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Sunday Times</a>&nbsp;in July 2021. “But it’s my life and I’m not doing anything to please people or to make it a better headline or story,” Florence added. “I want to also be a person!”</p><h2><strong>January 2022: Florence & Zach enjoy a date night</strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-16>Florence and Zach stepped out in January 2022 for a <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>dinner date</a> at the San Vicente Bungalows in West Hollywood, Calif. The&nbsp;Little Women&nbsp;star wore a patterned plunging sweater, black pants, and fuchsia heels, while the&nbsp;Garden State&nbsp;actor sported a black&nbsp;top under a black jacket with tan plaid pants and matching boots.</p><h2><strong>May 2022: Florence & Zach spark breakup rumors.</strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-17>Even though Florence claimed she and Will aren’t dating after their trip to Spain, she didn’t address the status of her relationship with Zach. That’s made fans think they are indeed broken up. In <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>her statement</a> shared to her IG Stories, Florence said that the rumors about her and Will were “getting a little silly.” She added, “I understand that the nature of this job is that you sometimes get your privacy completely bulldozed by paparazzi, but to fabricate this stuff actually does more damage than good.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9mamqFlkqeup7KMn6OoqpWjsKZ5z66eoWWimrmiwMiopaygmaV6tbXMnqOippVigXiAlXJramc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogInfo - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
