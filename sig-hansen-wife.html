I've fished in Norway as a teenager, and I enjoyed every minute of it. We try to visit Norway once a year to see family, but we weren't able to do that with COVID-19 the last few years... It was very exciting and rewarding to go back."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">How long have Sig and June Hansen been married?</h2><p>According to another report from <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Country Living</a>, the couple have been together for a whopping 24 years and counting.
