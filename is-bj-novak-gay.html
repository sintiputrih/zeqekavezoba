He received writing credit for 15 episodes, two of which—Diversity Day and Local Ad—received Writers Guild of America nominations.</p><p>Following The Office, B.J. Novak has primarily played supporting roles and made cameo appearances in films. His most prominent supporting performances have been in <strong>John Lee Hancock</strong>'s 2016 biographical drama The Founder, which is about the founder of McDonald's, and <strong>Quentin Tarantino</strong>'s critically acclaimed 2009 war movie Inglourious Basterds, which is about the development of the 1964 film Mary Poppins.</p><p>In other movies like Unaccompanied Minors, Knocked Up, Reign Over Me, The Internship, and The Amazing Spider-Man 2, BJ Novak has additionally appeared. In The Smurfs and The Smurfs 2, he also provided the voice of Baker Smurf, a character who only appears as the Smurfs' baker in the live-action Smurfs movies and in the Smurf comics.</p><p>In 2022, B.J. Novak attended the Oscars walk with his ex-girlfriend, Mindy Kaling. Many people thought the couple got back together. However, they are not together yet. In fact, B.J. is single and unmarried. As a result, some people wonder if he is gay. Well, here's everything we have on his relationship status and sexuality.</p><p>Previously, we touched on the&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel=noopener>orientation</a></strong> of <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Pete Williams</strong></a> and <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Chris Evans</strong></a>.</p><h2>Reddit: B.J. Novak Gay Is Not Gay Even if He Not Married and Is Single in 2022; The Office Star Previously Dated Mindy Karling!</h2><p><strong>B.J. Novak</strong> (<a href=# rel=noopener>@bjnovak</a>), who is best known for playing Ryan Howard from The Office, has managed to pique the interest of viewers and admirers. In 2022, the viewers are interested in his relationship status and want to know if he is gay. B.J. is not currently dating anyone, despite the fact that a few names come to mind while discussing his love life; as of 2022, he is still unmarried and single.</p><p>While some people take their time, others can quickly discover the proper mate. Similar to how some people can swiftly move on after a failed relationship, others find it difficult to let go of their ex-partner's memories.</p><p>If you are familiar with B.J. Novak, you probably are also familiar with <strong>Mindy Kaling </strong>(<a href=# rel=noopener>@mindykaling</a>), who also had a role in the NBC sitcom The Office, and she has been linked to the 43-year-old actor and Mindy is his ex-girlfriend.</p><p>Initially meeting while producing the NBC workplace comedy, Kaling and Novak dated intermittently between 2004 and 2007 before calling it quits. Despite their breakup, the two have remained close friends throughout the years and have even <a href=# rel=noopener>gone</a> on platonic dates together to red carpet events.</p><p>Perhaps their on-screen chemistry contributed to how compelling their characters were to watch. However, their romance was more of a passing phase than anything else, and by the time it ended in 2007, they had returned to being friends.</p><p>They understood that their relationship would always be platonic. They continued to collaborate on the show as friends up to The Office's finale. Currently, Kaling and Novak are a family, and Kaling even named Novak the godfather of her daughter in 2018 when she was born.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><p>In November 2016, it was also claimed that B.J. Novak was dating 21-year-old Instagram model <strong>Ceilidh Garten </strong>(<a href=# rel=noopener>@lilmixedhunny</a>). As Novak follows several Internet-famous beauties, according to the speculations made by the viewers, Novak first met Ceilidh online.</p><p>Although the reports stated Novak had broken off his relationship with Mindy, neither Novak nor Ceilidh have responded to the reports of their liaison. Since then, they haven't been photographed together in public and they haven't talked about their relationship on social media. So, maybe they dated or they didn't, only they know about this and they have yet to say anything on the matter.</p><p>Additionally, people in 2022 are speculating about B.J. Novak's sexual orientation because he hasn't been in a relationship in a while, despite the fact that he is not gay. Although the 43-year-old actor hasn't commented on the subject, based on his background and relationships with other women, we can reasonably assume that he is not gay. However, this is just speculation made by fans as the actor has yet to make comment on the subject.</p><p><strong>Visit&nbsp;<a href=#>Celebs In-depth</a>&nbsp;for more&nbsp;<a href=#>interesting stories</a>&nbsp;about your favorite celebs.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7%2FIp5ueqKSde6S7zGigrGWSn3qvu9Waomafka58</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogInfo - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
