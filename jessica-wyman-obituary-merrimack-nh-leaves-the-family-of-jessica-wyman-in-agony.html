Wyman. Merrimack, New Hampshire – Jessica L. Wyman, who had been a resident of Merrimack, New Hampshire for a very long time, passed away on Tuesday, November 28, 2023, at the Southern New Hampshire Medical Centre in Nashua, New Hampshire. She had fought bravely against occupational cancer stemming from her 26 years of service as a fire fighter. During her sixteen years of service with the Nashua Fire Department, Jess was the first female firefighter in the department’s history to be elevated to the rank of Lieutenant. She retired in 2017. Before she did that, Jess was employed by the Merrimack Fire Department as a firefighter and a paramedic.</p><p>She was also a Rescue Specialist for Massachusetts Task Force 1, which was an Urban Search and Rescue Team. She had been deployed multiple times across the country, including a deployment to New Orleans for a period of two weeks shortly following Hurricane Katrina. During her time at Southern New Hampshire Medical Centre, Jess held a number of positions, including that of paramedic and registered nurse, and most recently, she served as the Executive Director of In-Patient and Critical Care Services.</p><p>In the year 2021, she received her Doctor of Nursing Practice degree from Eastern Kentucky University, where she previously studied. In addition, Jess participated in a variety of sports during the course of her life. She was a world-ranked power lifter and competed in competitive events all over the country and in Europe. Some of the sports she participated in include football, hockey, and semi-professional football. In 2007, she established Camp Fully Involved, a programme that lasted for one week and was held at the New Hampshire Fire Academy.</p><p>It was designed for young women between the ages of 14 and 20 who had an interest in the fire service and emphasised the need of leadership, self-confidence, and strength. The programme motto “tell me and I forget; show me and I remember; involve me and I understand” was something that Jess lived by throughout her life.</p><p>Jess is survived by her mother, Jan (Hamel) White, who also resides in Merrimack, as well as her extended family. Christopher T. Wyman, her husband of 27 years, is also a member of the Winchester community. The Sky Meadow Country Club in Nashua, New Hampshire will be the location of a memorial service and celebration of life on Saturday, December 9, 2023.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmidpJq%2Fr63Loaanp6Keu6h6wqikaKKVqMCqr8BmrrKlkaN6sK7Irayaqqliuqa%2B0aKkmpubYrupecuemK%2Bdo2LBqbGMn5imoZyuerCyjKOcrKuZmK5uw9immKdlmaN6orPOp7Bo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogInfo - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
