When people think about <a href=#>TV horror</a>, they probably think of the zombies of The Walking Dead or an old episode of an anthology series like The Twilight Zone or Tales From the Crypt that haunted their dreams — or, more recently, Netflix’s very scary Guillermo del Toro’s Cabinet of Curiosities.<strong> </strong>The truth is that horror has been a reliable part of the TV landscape for generations, and it’s a remarkably diverse genre.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck2f4eo27001f3g67sif2q3mb@published data-word-count=73>Trimming this list down to fifty was difficult: There are truly terrifying episodes of Dexter, The Outer Limits, Fringe, and others that just barely missed the cut, and you could put together an entire separate list from the very best of Rod Serling’s groundbreaking masterpiece.

The Oscar winner helms the tale of a horror writer, played by Sam Waterston, who starts to see a disfigured man in every reflection. And the man is coming to kill him. It’s bad enough when it’s just in a mirror, but it’s eventually in glasses and even eyes.

The star of Booksmart plays Liv, a woman who has been struggling to get pregnant for years with her husband Matt. Right from the beginning, Lourd sells Liv’s emotional journey, so we believe she’ll jump when a receptionist at a fertility clinic offers a statue of a demon that can help make her pregnant. Of course, it’s not long after the baby is born that Liv starts seeing terrifying things on the baby monitor. Like most Stories, it has a twist too many, but Lourd even sells that aspect, highlighting how this woman has been gaslit and manipulated in a way that’s truly terrifying.</p>Stream at Hulu <a href=# data-track-type=product-link class=cta-link data-track-variant=streaming>Hulu</a><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cj8xam7to00033k5ycu8i44p5@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>American Horror Story, “Halloween”</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cj8xamnv7000r3k5yz2u2pjkg@published data-word-count=99>This list wouldn’t be complete without a chapter of Ryan Murphy’s pop-culture phenomenon, right? Even if it hasn’t been truly “scary” for a few seasons,<a href=#> this two-part episode from American Horror Story</a>’s first season revealed just how far Murphy and his team were willing to go. Written by James Wong and Tim Minear of The X-Files, both halves of “Halloween” represent Murphy’s vision for Murder House, burning the American dream down in a nightmare vision of rubber men and child ghosts.

Revealing that Dr. Thredson is the horrible serial killer Bloody Face, who also happens to be a necrophiliac, it is arguably still AHS at its most insane. With its images of Wendy’s desecrated corpse and the mangled form of the tortured Shelley, the episode got some flack for being misogynistic, but it undeniably contains some of the most unforgettable imagery in a series that’s designed to get people talking.

The excellent character actor Beth Grant plays a ghost who haunts Cordelia’s new pad, and there’s some great imagery here, such as a face coming through the wall and Grant’s first appearance in the mirror. It’s an episode that sneaks up on you, revealing that Angel could play with different tones and themes than fans may have been expecting.</p>Stream on Hulu <a href=# data-track-type=product-link class=cta-link data-track-variant=streaming>Hulu</a><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cl9n5bfft00c33b72vdocw1mz@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>Archive 81, “Mystery Signals”</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl9n5bjoa00cz3b72il706jft@published data-word-count=145>Rebecca Sonnenshine’s <a href=#>underrated thriller</a> was canceled by Netflix after only one season, but it feels likely to develop a cult following with time. That would be a fitting destiny for the series in that Archive 81 is about discovery, the kind that reshapes the way you see the world. While there’s not one standout terrifying chapter of the show, the series premiere really casts a mood, setting up what’s to come perfectly. It introduces us to Dan (the excellent Mamoudou Athie), who has been hired to restore some mysterious video footage regarding a deadly apartment fire. As he watches a grad student named Melody (Dina Shihabi) investigate, he is drawn into the tapes, eventually leading to a riveting break in time and space.

Pick the wrong door, and there he’ll be.” An entire generation was permanently scarred by the ‘90s cable executive who thought it was cool to put this show on Nickelodeon. Yes, the child performers and generally goofy tone scream Nickelodeon, but then there’s the damn clown episode that no one can forget. While a lot of Are You Afraid of the Dark? was harmless cheese, this one merged both creepy carnival culture and the scariest thing in the world: clowns. A kid goes into a fun house in a carnival and dares to steal the nose of the legendary Zeebo. Refusing to believe the urban legends about the clown or the carnival, the cocky Josh gets what he deserves when Zeebo comes looking for his red squishy nose. No wonder so many ‘90s kids grew up to be horror fans — they were chasing Zeebo.</p>Stream on Paramount+ <a href=# data-track-type=product-link class=cta-link data-track-variant=streaming>Paramount+</a><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckgsg42zz00493g6g8t1jrmss@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>Atlanta, “Teddy Perkins”</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckgsg47l700533g6gfon1ttiy@published data-word-count=167>In general, <a href=#>Donald Glover’s masterful FX show </a>would be classified as a comedy — but then there’s the sixth episode of season two, which is something else altogether. The great director Hiro Murai collaborated with Glover on one of the most <a href=#>unsettling half-hours of TV</a> in the 2010s, an experience that unfolded without commercial breaks. Darius (Lakeith Stanfield) goes to a mansion to pick up a free piano with a U-Haul, and gets sucked into the realm of a man named Teddy Perkins, played by Glover under so much heavy make-up that Stanfield reportedly <a href=#>didn’t even realize</a> it was him and he isn’t credited in the episode itself. Murai and cinematographer Christian Springer were influenced by The Shining in the design of the episode and Glover’s whiteface make-up was compared to Michael Jackson, although there is a lot more going on here beyond parody. It’s as innovative a half-hour of television as any show had the guts to air in the last decade. And it’s deeply unsettling.</p>Stream on Hulu <a href=# data-track-type=product-link class=cta-link data-track-variant=streaming>Hulu</a><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clnw62lij000n3b7odpgbemqu@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>Black Mirror, “Beyond the Sea”</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clnw62lik000o3b7o6qtd5luq@published data-word-count=130>The 2023 season of Black Mirror is a rollercoaster of quality, but there seems to be consensus around one devastating chapter, an emotional journey through trauma that culminates in a finale that’s arguably the most viciously brutal in the history of Charlie Brooker’s show. Directed by John Crowley (Brooklyn), “Beyond the Sea” is the tale of two astronauts — Josh Hartnett and Aaron Paul — who can visit home despite being far off in space thanks to a sort of avatar or replica. When cultists butcher one of their families back on Earth, the emotional chasm between the two careens toward a deadly conclusion. All the performers here are excellent, especially Paul, but it’s the gut punch of an ending that makes it terrifying enough to land on this list.</p>Stream on Netflix <a href=# data-track-type=product-link class=cta-link data-track-variant=streaming>Netflix</a><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cj8xamag600053k5yw7ui1a2l@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>Black Mirror, “Playtest”</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cj8xamp55000t3k5yjf0r1to7@published data-word-count=97>There are better episodes of <a href=#>Black Mirror</a> —&nbsp;“The Entire History of You” and “Be Right Back” come to mind —&nbsp;but none that are as flat-out horrifying as <a href=#>this third-season episode starring Wyatt Russell</a>. With references to genre classics like Bioshock and Resident Evil, “Playtest” features a man who literally enters a survival horror video-game experience. At first, he presumes he can stay emotionally detached from the nightmare around him, but he soon realizes that his experience will be more reality than virtual.

Who could guess that one of the scariest hours of TV history would be largely silent? In “Hush,” Buffy and the rest of the Scooby Gang cross paths with the Gentlemen, a nightmarish group of well-dressed demons who steal your voice before they cut out your heart. Written and directed by Joss Whedon, “Hush” is a stand-alone masterpiece, the rare hour of an episodic series that someone could watch and love never having seen the rest of the show.</p>Stream on Hulu <a href=# data-track-type=product-link class=cta-link data-track-variant=streaming>Hulu</a><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cl9o9n35w000z3b73lsgyqdvg@published>Bonus episode — Buffy the Vampire Slayer, “Conversations With Dead People”</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjnqar1d800bp3h62qtwa2fci@published data-word-count=88>The best episode of Buffy’s final season isn’t really designed as a pure frightfest but it contains some startling, horrifying imagery nonetheless. Just imagine if your dead loved one came back to you but was being held prisoner by a demon. Or if you could talk to your murdered girlfriend only to have that discussion turned into a nightmare. The writing on this episode by Drew Goddard and Jane Espenson (again) has really held up over time, as have the deeper, more heartbreaking fears with which it plays.</p>Stream on Hulu <a href=# data-track-type=product-link class=cta-link data-track-variant=streaming>Hulu</a><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ck2eyy71g005w3g67tmpa4eog@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>Castle Rock, “The Queen”</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck2eyxsii00573g67jvgb5lr6@published data-word-count=157>One of the many remarkable elements of<a href=#> Hulu’s excellent Castle Rock</a>, a show set in the Stephen King multiverse, is that it doesn’t scare you in a traditional way. The writers aren’t even big on killer clowns or creepy kids in hotel hallways. The sense of unease and horror in this series often hinges on a supernatural construct but comes from something relatable. Take <a href=#>this incredible episode</a>. In one of the best performances of Sissy Spacek’s career (and shame on all the awards-giving bodies who snubbed it), the Oscar winner plays a woman teetering on the edge of sanity, unsure not just of what is happening but when. It’s a perfectly constructed examination of dementia, a state in which our memories and our present day can intertwine and get jumbled to such a degree that tragedy can ensue. The final scenes of “The Queen” are as devastating as anything in genre television over the past few years.</p>Stream on Hulu <a href=# data-track-type=product-link class=cta-link data-track-variant=streaming>Hulu</a><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cj8xamcip00093k5yolkt28wr@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>Channel Zero: No-End House, “This Isn’t Real”</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cj8xamt2v000z3k5yn9qfqluf@published data-word-count=134>The least-famous show on this list is one you should definitely watch if you’re a horror fan. Ending its four-season run, SyFy’s Channel Zero is based on the most popular tales from the web horror genre known as creepypasta. The first season was a solid outing, based on the Candle Cove story, but the second has stepped up the weird terror to another level. No-End House initially appears to be a standard haunted-house tale — the new mansion on the end of the block that promises six rooms of spine-shattering fear — but episodes like “This Isn’t Real” owe more to David Lynch and David Cronenberg than anything else. Plus, co-star John Carroll Lynch does fantastic supporting work. The season premiere was the creepiest hour of TV in 2017 that didn’t star Kyle MacLachlan.</p>Buy at Amazon <a href=# data-track-type=product-link class=cta-link data-track-variant=streaming>Amazon</a><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cj8xamdoq000b3k5yeqn6h9pt@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>Doctor Who, “Blink”</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cj8xamveu00123k5ydk8rj0ri@published data-word-count=122>“Don’t blink. Blink and you’re dead. Don’t turn your back. Don’t look away. And don’t blink.” Starring a pre-fame Carey Mulligan, this third-season episode of the British hit stands out for a number of reasons, but none more than the Weeping Angels. As with most episodes of Doctor Who, there’s time travel and witty banter, but what’s unforgettable about “Blink” are those aliens masquerading as angelic religious statues, figures with their hands over their eyes and murder in their hearts. They move if you’re not looking at them. They’ll kill you in the time it takes to blink. Like “Hush,” this is a perfect stand-alone hour of TV that you can watch even if you’re not in the cult of the Doctor.</p>Stream on Max <a href=# data-track-type=product-link class=cta-link data-track-variant=streaming>Max</a><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cl9o9o8od001a3b73upqo4hnl@published>Bonus episode — Doctor Who, “Listen”</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjnqan6e4008p3h627ouptkx9@published data-word-count=99>One of the best modern episodes of Doctor Who is also one of the most chill-inducing hours of television of the 2010s.

With echoes of classic network genre TV like The X-Files (the two leads here are so much like Scully and Mulder in their skeptic-and-believer dynamic that Chris Carter deserves royalties), <a href=#>Evil is incredibly effective television</a>. The best example is the excellent premiere episode, which introduces us to Kristen Bouchard (Katja Herbers), David Acosta (Mike Colter), and, oh yeah, a demon named George (Marti Matulis), who torments Kristen in the middle of the night while she lies frozen in bed, unable to move. Creepy and moody haven’t been used to describe a CBS show in a long time, but they definitely fit here.</p>Stream on Paramount+ <a href=# data-track-type=product-link class=cta-link data-track-variant=streaming>Paramount+</a><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clnw63cw7000v3b7oic8t49mf@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>The Fall of the House of Usher, “The Tell-Tale Heart”</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clnw63cw8000w3b7o6vdpwa57@published data-word-count=194>Any number of the eight episodes in the 2023 season of Mike Flanagan’s adaptation of the work of Edgar Allen Poe could qualify for a feature like this one. More than any Flanagan project, The Fall of the House of Usher is an unforgivingly brutal sequence of comeuppances for its characters, using some of the new master of horror’s greatest tricks to dispatch them. Flanagan and his team cleverly twist Poe’s short stories to fit their narrative of the literal destruction of a powerful family, and the most unforgettably vicious chapter comes just past the halfway point of the season in their riff on “The Tell-Tale Heart.” By this point in the show, there have been multiple brutal deaths, but the reveal of what Victorine did to Al is one of the most WTF moments in the history of television, followed by the undeniable horror of what she then does in front of her father. There may be moodier episodes of this show that one could argue should be here instead, but this is a representative of the overall fearlessness of The Fall of the House of Usher to provide images you can’t forget.</p>Stream on Netflix <a href=# data-track-type=product-link class=cta-link data-track-variant=streaming>Netflix</a><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cl9n83uwk00uq3b72ghhi3oct@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>Fear Itself, “Eater”</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl9n84bd400ve3b72k72yphrp@published data-word-count=169>In summer 2008, NBC launched its own version of Masters of Horror with the short-lived Fear Itself, created by Mick Garris. It was a massive bomb, pulled from the network before its final five episodes were even allowed to air, but it did have a few standout chapters, including “Skin & Bones” by Larry Fessenden and “The Sacrifice” with a young Jesse Plemons. The best episode was the fifth, “Eater,” directed by the legendary Stuart Gordon (Re-Animator) and starring Elisabeth Moss, Russell Hornsby, and Pablo Schreiber. Moss plays a young cop at a station that happens to be housing a vicious serial killer who has been known to eat his victims, slowly and painfully. As the night goes on, the Mad Men star becomes convinced that there’s more to the Eater than mere cannibalism, coming to believe that her fellow male cops are being impacted by the killing machine. It’s hard to believe this commentary on gender roles, washed in Gordon’s skillfully rendered gooey gore, was on network TV.</p>Stream on Vudu <a href=# data-track-type=product-link class=cta-link data-track-variant=streaming>Vudu</a><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckgsgd8mi008j3g6g0ygmlc6z@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>Fringe, “Marionette”</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckgsgo2oq009e3g6g4gf7iiou@published data-word-count=136>Often more science fiction than horror, FOX’s Fringe still had a tendency, not unlike The X-Files, to get pretty damn creepy — and never more so than in this season-three episode, a brilliant hour that tied the overall narrative about alternating universes into a terrifying case-of-the-week. The great Mark Ivanir plays a man who has been compassionately harvesting organs all around town, leaving his victims more alive than they should be after he takes their body parts. As if that’s not creepy enough, it’s revealed that he’s been taking the organs to put in the body of a ballerina who committed suicide and bring her back to life. The image of his own Frankenstein’s monster installed in what’s basically a marionette system by her creator is one of the show’s most memorable in its entire run.</p>Stream on Max and Prime Video <a href=# data-track-type=product-link class=cta-link data-track-variant=streaming>Max</a> <a href=# data-track-type=product-link class=cta-link data-track-variant=streaming>Prime Video</a><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cl9n8f0zq00zw3b72d2yxyocs@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>Guillermo del Toro’s Cabinet of Curiosities, “The Murmuring”</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl9n8frrq010j3b72ci0z918s@published data-word-count=167>The brilliant Guillermo del Toro has produced an anthology series for Netflix that echoes projects like Masters of Horror, presenting eight different episodes by eight excellent horror directors, including Panos Cosmatos (Mandy), David Prior (The Empty Man) and Ana Lily Amirpour (A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night). The best of the bunch reunites The Babadook director Jennifer Kent with the star of that film, Essie Davis. The phenomenally talented Davis plays a grieving bird expert, filming flocks of birds on a nature project with her husband (an excellent Andrew Lincoln) and living in a creepy old house while she does. As something in the house starts to try to get her attention, “The Murmuring” becomes a perfect distillation of Kent’s interests and those of del Toro, who wrote the story on which this chapter is based. A bit of Babadook maternal horror plus a helping of Crimson Peak haunted house fare equals an unforgettable short film. Available to stream on Netflix as of October 28, 2022.</p>Stream on Netflix <a href=# data-track-type=product-link class=cta-link data-track-variant=streaming>Netflix</a><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjnqaswuc00c83h62yxvysex4@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>Hammer House of Horror, “The House That Bled to Death”</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjnqat20m00cr3h62uw5bu6ae@published data-word-count=97>Only the Brits would pour blood all over a children’s birthday party.

The penultimate chapter of The Last of Us centers Ellie and her discovery of a vile preacher named David, a cultist who has turned his people into monsters by feeding them human flesh.

Her husband (Hamish Linklater) is accused of and then confesses to a lifetime of horrific crimes involving his patients as a pediatrician, leaving Beharie’s character haunted by the decisions she’s made over her life, and maybe even the times she looked the other way, including possibly with her own son.

His boredom leads him to a beautiful woman and her older husband, deciding that he will do whatever it takes to have her. When another Brit suggests a regional murder technique in which an earwig is put in the victim’s ear and eats its way to its brain, Hervey agrees, only to wake up and find out that he’s become the host of the bug of death by accident.

Most of the show hinged more on science-fiction ideas than horror, but this 1963 episode is a nice blend of the two.

The opening scene is a beauty, as a cleaning lady tries to suck up a dust bunny and appears to be scared to death by what comes bursting out of the vacuum cleaner. The reveal — that a mad scientist is using a malevolent force to kill people and then bring them back to life — is something straight out of Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein.

When his son reaches the right age, he takes him to the same playground, but his demons come with him.

You might want to cancel that road trip about now.</p>Stream on Max <a href=# data-track-type=product-link class=cta-link data-track-variant=streaming>Max</a><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cl9nb0jkp01r43b72fcy7800t@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>Thriller, “Pigeons from Hell”</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl9nb112q01rf3b72hfrkki4v@published data-word-count=140>Thriller doesn’t get the same attention as beloved anthologies The Twilight Zone or The Outer Limits, but it produced some absolute gems. The best episode of the Boris Karloff series adapts a short story written by Robert E. Howard that was published way back in 1938. Broadcast in the first season of the NBC show in 1961, two years before The Birds by the way, “Pigeons from Hell” tells the tale of two brothers (Brandon De Wilde & David Whorf) who break down in the deep South and find themselves at a haunted plantation. After one of the brothers appears to lose his mind, the other brings in a Sheriff to investigate, discovering the history of the plantation and the unsettling birds that keep appearing there. It’s a little dated but there’s an eerie power to its visuals that’s timeless.</p>Stream on the Roku Channel <a href=# data-track-type=product-link class=cta-link data-track-variant=streaming>Roku Channel</a><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cj8xamhgj000j3k5ylmkz7hru@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>The Twilight Zone, “Living Doll”</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cj8xan80d001h3k5y43kp8j5w@published data-word-count=96>Much like the other anthology series on this list, there are so many Twilight Zone episodes to choose from. Obvious choices like “To Serve Man” and “Nightmare at 20,000 Feet” are ones you’ve probably seen a dozen times, so why not dig a little deeper and pull out some nightmare fuel? Before Chucky and Annabelle, there was Talky Tina, a young girl’s new best friend and her stepfather’s new enemy. “Living Doll” is worth a watch just for the perfectly chilling final line: “My name is Talky Tina … and you’d better be nice to me!”</p>Stream on Paramount+ <a href=# data-track-type=product-link class=cta-link data-track-variant=streaming>Paramount+</a><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cl9o9sbpu001v3b73dvvnirxz@published>Bonus episode — The Twilight Zone, “The Hitch-Hiker”</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjnqawy2200ll3h6265xwz3qn@published data-word-count=106>There are obviously a dozen or more choices to make from Rod Serling’s masterpiece, one of the best shows of all time. You could really just sample it all day on Halloween and find enough frights. But make sure to include this gem, the story of a woman who barely survives a car accident only to be visited over and over again by a mysterious hitchhiker as she continues on her way. Based on a radio play by Louise Fletcher, “The Hitch-Hiker” also has echoes of the masterful horror movie Carnival of Souls, a personal favorite.

In the mid-’80s, an incredibly talented crew that included Wes Craven and Harlan Ellison teamed up to reimagine the Rod Serling classic for a new generation. This is the peak of their endeavor, the third chapter of the fourth episode, from way back in 1985. The story of a Vietnam vet who ends up at a rain-soaked diner in the middle of the night was directed by the legendary William Friedkin (The Exorcist), and his incredible talent shows through in every paranoid frame. A cop pushes a vet to talk about ’Nam before realizing that the sweaty traveler has literally brought the war home with him. The action-packed finale shows off Friedkin’s gift with such things, and the theme of the piece — how veterans sometimes feel like they never left combat — comes out in fascinating, horrifying ways.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cj8xamimu000l3k5yrbjeuwgq@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>Twin Peaks, “Lonely Souls”</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cj8xan6bl001e3k5y5r1orma2@published data-word-count=102>There are plenty of choices from Twin Peaks and <a href=#>Twin Peaks: The Return</a> that would fit this list, but the season-two episode “Lonely Souls” is the one that will most haunt you. Directed by David Lynch himself, it gave viewers what they thought they wanted at the end of season one — the truth about Laura Palmer’s murder — but then made them realize how much they really didn’t want to know or see. When Leland Palmer, flipping back and forth between his real self and that of the demonic Killer Bob, kills Madeline, it was like nothing ever seen on television.</p>Stream on Paramount+ <a href=# data-track-type=product-link class=cta-link data-track-variant=streaming>Paramount+</a><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cj8xamjfb000n3k5y3rzs1c2k@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>The Walking Dead, “Days Gone Bye”</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cj8xankjo001k3k5y1tgmdnw7@published data-word-count=120>This AMC hit has so many deaths and horrific moments, they can often blend together after all these years. Although season three’s “Seed” might be more straight-up terrifying, “Days Gone Bye” is where the Walking Dead phenomenon began. Directed by Frank Darabont, this episode felt like a breakthrough when it aired in 2010. It was more like a short film than what we expected from basic cable TV —&nbsp;partially because it was shot on 16mm — and it revealed how far The Walking Dead would go in terms of gore and violence usually reserved for R-rated films. “Days Gone Bye” played a big role in tilting prestige TV toward horror, and it’s still one of the best episodes you’ll find.</p>Stream on Netflix <a href=# data-track-type=product-link class=cta-link data-track-variant=streaming>Netflix</a><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cj8xb99yz00043k5yy2qh2ue9@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>The X-Files, “Home”</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cj8xb96r000023k5yotbspkof@published data-word-count=86>An episode of television so disturbing that Fox seems almost apologetic that they ever aired it. For years, “Home” wasn’t included in syndicated rotation of The X-Files because it was deemed too much for audiences to experience again. In this stand-alone episode, Mulder and Scully investigate a family of deformed people who haven’t left their home in years —&nbsp;and they find dark secrets hiding under the floorboards. Incredibly violent and grotesque even by today’s standards, “Home” has lost none of its brutal power two decades later.</p>Stream on Hulu and Freevee <a href=# data-track-type=product-link class=cta-link data-track-variant=streaming>Hulu</a> <a href=# data-track-type=product-link class=cta-link data-track-variant=streaming>Freevee</a><h2 class=related-title data-editable=title>Related</h2><ul class=related-links data-editable=relatedItems><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/cl8vrngv40000opfgxs6ep4hw@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>A Spooky Guide to the Best New Horror to Stream This October</span></a></li><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/ambrose-923e58d43e0abe4896f53d4d9e37f787@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>25 Great Halloween Sitcom Episodes to Stream During Spooky Season</span></a></li><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/cl9h8ksc80000f8iq42vutyji@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>21 Horror Games to Play This Spooky Season</span></a></li></ul><span class=ambrose-short-hed>The 50 Scariest TV Episodes to Watch This Halloween</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57wKuropucmny0r8CroJ6rpGLBt3nEqaCsp5SawG6x1Z6pZ6Ckork%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogInfo - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
