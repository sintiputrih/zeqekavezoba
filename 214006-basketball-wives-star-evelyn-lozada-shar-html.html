In the <a class="Ed a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://youtu.be/PuUmZz73Rww>introductory video</a>, the then-21-year-old woman admitted that there was never a dull moment having Lozada as her mother.</p><p class=fh>However, she admitted that being the child of a famous person made her feel as if she didn't have her own identity, mainly because people would often refer to her as "Evelyn Lozada's daughter."</p><p class=fh>As a result, she started making a name for herself at a young age, got financially independent, and became a fashion and lifestyle entrepreneur. Nowadays, Hairston is an Internet celebrity with over 900,000 <a class="Ed a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/shanieceh/>followers on Instagram</a>.</p><p class=fh>In November 2018, Hairston <a class="Ed a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.bet.com/celebrities/news/2018/11/07/evelyn-lozada-s-daughter-addresses-rumors-shes-dating-usher.html>made headlines</a> after it was rumored that she was dating "Love in This Club" singer Usher after both of them were seen together at the birthday party of Diddy.</p><p class=fh>Eventually, it was reported that they were indeed at the party, but that they didn't leave together and were not in a romantic relationship. At the moment, and judging by Hairston's social media posts, she is single and focused on her career.</p><p class=fh>Unfortunately, her family was a direct victim of the novel coronavirus as Lozada's stepfather, Larry, passed away from the disease. On the day that would have been his birthday, the "Basketball Wife" star <a class="Ed a" href=#>shared a touching tribute</a> to him.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmtobWhga3qjrdKknK2akaG5bsPIr5ysZaOprrN5xK%2BcpbGeYrmwxsCdmGarmJa%2Fb7TTpqM%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogInfo - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
