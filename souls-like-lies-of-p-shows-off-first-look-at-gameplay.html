The response to the announcement was generally “it’s a Souls-like based on what?” but the gameplay shown honestly looks pretty good.</p><p>The game seems like it’s more inspired by Bloodborne than Dark Souls, with fast-paced combat and a more Victorian setting. It also seems to pull from Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice’s grapple hook, with one shot showing you pulling an enemy from a separate rooftop. A variety of weapons were on show, including an axe, a sword, some kind of flamethrower, and a huge buzzsaw.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/storage.googleapis.com/gamebyte/2021/11/3473f4c7-lies-of-p.jpg><p>You seemingly fight off various puppet like enemies, and play as Pinocchio himself. The game’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam page</a> describes the game saying, “Inspired by the familiar story of Pinocchio, Lies of P is an action souls-like game set in a cruel, dark Belle Époque world. All of humanity is lost in a once beautiful city that has now become a living hell filled with unspeakable horrors. Lies of P offers an elegant world filled with tension, a deep combat system and a gripping story. Guide Pinocchio and experience his unrelenting journey to become human.”</p><h2>the dark souls of politics</h2><p>One particular shot shows a puppet strung up with the acronym “APAB” sprayed on a piece of hood hanging from it. This is in reference to the phrase “all cops are bastards”, a phrase that portrays the idea that police as an institution are all bad. The fact this is included could point Lies of P toward being a somewhat political game. But how that will take shape remains to be seen.</p><p>Apparently more info will be revealed later this month at the South Korean gaming convention <a href=#>G-Star</a>. Lies of P is expected to release 2023, on PS5, Xbox Series S/X, and PC.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.ytimg.com/vi/QzE4WBKs98o/hqdefault.jpg><h3><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Shop With GameByte!</strong></a></h3><p>Don’t forget you can find great games and more on the<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> GameByte Shop</a>!
