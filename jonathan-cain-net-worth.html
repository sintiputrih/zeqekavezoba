He attended Our Lady of the Angels Catholic school where he survived a fire that killed three nuns and over 90 students. This tragedy pushed him away from religion, but his father encouraged his musical talent and shifted his focus to music. Cain began taking accordion lessons at the age of 8 and eventually learned to play piano, bass, guitar, and harmonica. He graduated from East Leyden High School in 1968 and went on to attend the Chicago Conservatory of Music.</p><h2><span id=Jonathan_Cains_Music_Career>Jonathan Cain’s Music Career</span></h2><p>Jonathan Cain began his music career in 1976, releasing his debut album “Windy City Breakdown” under the name the Jonathan Cain Band. He later joined the Babys in 1979, performing on their albums “Union Jacks” and “On the Edge” in 1980.</p><p>In the same year, Cain left the Babys to join Journey as their new keyboardist, replacing Gregg Rolie. His first album with the band was “Escape” in 1981, which was a massive success, achieving Diamond certification. Cain was responsible for creating one of the most iconic opening keyboard riffs in rock history on the hit song “Don’t Stop Believin’.”</p><p>Journey’s peak success came with lead singer Steve Perry, but the band has since been led by Arnel Pineda.</p><h2><span id=Bad_English_and_Jimmy_Barnes>Bad English and Jimmy Barnes</span></h2><p>Jonathan Cain wrote and produced the 1985 hit song “Working Class Man” for Jimmy Barnes.

They alleged that the men had engaged in an attempted corporate coup d’état to gain control of Nightmare Productions, which they believed was in control of the Journey name and logo. Valory countersued for emotional distress and breach of contract. Ultimately, all parties resolved their differences and reached an amicable settlement agreement.</p><h2><span id=Jonathan_Cains_Personal_Life_and_Philanthropy>Jonathan Cain’s Personal Life and Philanthropy</span></h2><p>Jonathan Cain married Tané McClure in 1980, and they divorced in 1984.
