While Garcia was live on Instagram, Danis interrupted him, prompting Garcia to immediately call him out in front of a vast audience.</p><p>Garcia didn't hold back, even mentioning McGregor's name as he accused Danis of imitating the Irish star. In retaliation, Danis resorted to targeting Garcia's former partner Andrea Celina on social media, employing a similar tactic he had used against Logan Paul before suffering defeat in his boxing debut against a WWE star.</p><h2 id=ryan-garcia-blasts-dillon-danis-on-instagram-live>Ryan Garcia Blasts Dillon Danis On Instagram Live</h2><h3 id=garcia-called-danis-a-lsquo-clown-rsquo-in-a-heated-rant>Garcia Called Danis A ‚ÄòClown‚Äô In A Heated Rant</h3><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>‚ÄúOh my gosh, there goes Dillon Danis,‚Äù he said in reaction to the jiu-jitsu star joining his IG Live sessions, continuing:, ‚ÄúHey bro I know that check is running out, relax. Yo, it‚Äôs not a game all the time Dillon Danis. That sh*t is real life, you keep playing.‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúYou really not sh*t Bro you literally got beat up by Logan Paul, you‚Äôre not sh*t bro. You‚Äôve been fu**ing up for years and years and years you had a chance and then you went and looked stupid in the ring. Literally you‚Äôre not shit, you‚Äôre just an idiot.‚Äù</p><p>Garcia asserted that Danis lacks writing skills and cast doubt on his intelligence. Whether there was pre-existing animosity between them before the Instagram Live clash remains uncertain, but it wouldn't be surprising if Danis had previously made insensitive remarks towards Garcia.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=dillon-danis-issues-a-threat-to-garcia-with-andrea-celina-video>Dillon Danis Issues A Threat To Garcia With Andrea Celina Video</h2><h3 id=danis-implies-garcia-and-celina-is-his-next-target-for-trolling>Danis Implies Garcia and Celina Is His Next Target For Trolling</h3><p>Ryan Garcia recently declared that his marriage to Drea Celina had reached an irreparable state, filing for divorce citing "irreconcilable differences," notably shortly after the birth of their second child.</p><p>In response, Danis posted a video of Celina dancing, seemingly attempting to provoke Garcia with the caption, "You poked the wrong bear @RyanGarcia üëÄ."
