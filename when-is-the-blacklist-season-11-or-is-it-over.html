The hugely successful crime thriller chronicled the activities of Raymond Reddington, a wanted fugitive who later agrees to cooperate with the FBI and catch other criminals/terrorists in exchange for immunity.</strong></p><p>From episode to episode, fans saw Reddington work together with intelligent agents such as Elizabeth Keen and reel in all manner of criminals whilst also trying to avoid any blowback. Fans would have loved the show to go on forever but as they often say, all good things must come to an end.</p><h2><strong>When Does The Blacklist Return?</strong></h2><p>The Blacklist aired its final episode, Season 10 Episode 22, on the 13th of July, 2023. Therefore, the series is not coming back, as there won’t be a Season 11 of the Blacklist. All fans can now look forward to is the reruns of the show. They may also catch up on the spin-off series, the Blacklist: Redemption, which aired in 2017. It focuses on Tom Keen, Elizabeth’s husband, a secret agent who stumbles upon mind-blowing discoveries about his mom and dad (previously believed to be dead).</p><h2><strong>Why was The Blacklist Cancelled?</strong></h2><p>The Blacklist was not canceled. Rather, the production network, NBC, decided to conclude the series with the 10th season. The reason for this was to avoid a situation where the story would veer into a direction entirely different from the original vision and now become unrecognizable to fans.</p><p>James Spader, the man who expertly portrayed Reddington put it perfectly by saying that if the show went beyond 10th year, it would turn into a very <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">different</a> show. According to him, if the Blacklist went much further, it would just become something that would be less recognizable. He didn’t want such a scenario to materialize, and as such, he agreed with the decision to end the Blacklist with Season 10.</p><h2><strong>Which Is The Blacklist Final Season?</strong></h2><p>The final season of The Blacklist is Season 10. Season 10 had a total of 22 episodes, and the very first episode originally aired on the 26th of February, 2023. Other episodes subsequently aired weekly up until the 13th of July 2023. Season 10 of The Blacklist saw Reddington face some formidable opponents.</p><p>First up were some of the criminals he had helped take down who were out for his blood. Even more formidable was Congressman Arthur Hudson, who was determined to uncover the truth about the FBI task force that Reddington works with. Reddington faces a real prospect of being arrested and so decides to flee.</p><h3><strong>The Blacklist Cast: List of the Blacklist Actors and Actresses</strong></h3><ul><li>James Spader</li><li>Megan Boone</li><li>Diego Klattenhoff</li><li>Ryan Eggold</li><li>Harry Lennix</li><li>Parminder Nagra</li><li>Anya Banerjee</li><li>Amir Arison</li><li>Hisham Tawfiq</li><li>Mozhan Marnò</li><li>Laura Sohn</li><li>Alan Alda</li><li>Chin Han</li><li>Margarita Levieva</li><li>Peter Stormare</li><li>Susan Blommaer</li><li>Teddy Coluca</li><li>Mary-Louise Parker</li><li>David Strathairn</li><li>Reed Birney</li><li>Tom Connoly</li><li>Deidre Lovejoy</li><li>Fisher Stevens</li><li>Lance Henriksen</li><li>Edi Gathegi</li><li>Famke Janssen</li><li>Ulrich Thomsen</li><li>Leon Rippy</li><li>Enrique Murciano</li><li>Michael Aronov</li><li>Aida Turturro</li><li>Jonny Coyne</li><li>Fiona Dourif</li><li>Jonathan Holtzman</li><li>Genson Blimline</li><li>Nathan Lane</li><li>John Waters</li><li>Coy Stewart</li><li>Stacy Keach</li><li>Laila Robins</li><li>Brett Cullen</li><li>Joely Richardson</li><li>Al Roker</li><li>Reg Rogers</li><li>Lukas Hassel</li><li>Diany Rodriguez</li><li>Karina Arroyave</li><li>Brian Dennehy</li><li>Clark Middleton</li></ul><h2><strong>When is The Blacklist Season 10 Release Date on Netflix?</strong></h2><p>Season 10 of The Blacklist is expected to be available on Netflix between September and October 2023.
