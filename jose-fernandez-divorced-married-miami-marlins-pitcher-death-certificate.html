The latest shocker involves his relationship history, as Jose’s death certificate, obtained by <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>TMZ</a>, lists him as “divorced.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Jose’s marriage history wasn’t known before TMZ’s revelation. He was single when he was found dead on Sept. 25, 2016. He actually left behind a pregnant girlfriend, <strong>Maria Arias</strong>, 24, who was carrying a Jose’s baby girl. The death certificate doesn’t list a former spouse, so the big question is – who’s the former Mrs. Jose Fernandez?</p><p id=content-paragraph-4><strong>Update:&nbsp;</strong>Jose married to his high school sweetheart <strong>Alejandra Baleato Marichal</strong> in 2012, according to the sleuths at <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>TMZ</a>. They were both 20 at the time and this marriage only lasted 18 months.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>[jwplatform 75lRgz44-go2lr4C1]</p><h3><a href=# rel=noopener>Jose Fernandez Memorial — See Pictures From The Sad Event</a></h3><p id=content-paragraph-6>Jose’s whole dating history has been a major source of confusion since he died. At first, people mistook&nbsp;<strong>Carla Mendoza</strong>&nbsp;as his baby mama as initial stories listed her as the woman carrying his child. Not so! Carla publicly said that she wasn’t pregnant and her mother actually revealed that the two split months before his death. Carla, according to her mom, wanted to get married after she graduated nursing school in May 2017, but Jose’s agent reportedly told him to wait until he got a new contract. This caused the two to begin arguing, and ultimately, they broke up in April 2016.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Though Jose would move on to Maria, there was no bad blood between the two women following his death. “My heart goes out to Maria,” Carla wrote after hearing news of Jose’s passing, <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>sharing her message </a>on Instagram on Sept. 27. “I’m sure this is all to painful for her…my deepest love goes out. The heartbreak is unbearable.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Maria was expected to give birth to Jose’s daughter sometime in February 2017, according to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>TMZ</a>. Will this baby girl inherit his estimated $6.5 million dollar estate? The daughter could be considered an “after-born heir,” attorney <strong>Robert Wallack</strong> EXCLUSIVELY told <strong>HollywoodLife.com</strong>, and thus, she could be worth millions of dollars. Yes, even though Maria and Jose weren’t married, the girl – who Jose wanted to name <strong>Penelope</strong> – could get it all. Though, with a possible ex-wife now in the picture, could there be some drama over who really inherits his MLB fortune? Yikes!</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>What do you think about this latest development, <strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWlnZH1ze5FtZqOno5p6p7HRp5innJWveqW11aipnJ2UYrqivtGinJ1lnZ6urrWMppirpJmjwG68yK2aoZ2iYrGmrdOhZJydoqm2p7XCmqueZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogInfo - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
