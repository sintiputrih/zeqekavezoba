Deputies found a man and woman with several gunshot wounds on the pavement outside the front door.</p><p>The home was declared a crime scene and residents were requested to leave. They interviewed residents whose identities were not mentioned in the affidavit.</p><p>The affidavit revealed that Josaphat’s victims recently married. Over a year ago, Josaphat lived at the home where the incident occurred. He still “shows up from time to time” and may be “controlling” and “asking probative questions” about the woman who lives there.</p><p>Due to Marsy’s Law, police haven’t named the victims. The redacted affidavit stated that Josaphat and the woman within the home had a history that culminated on October 5, 2023. Palm Beach County court records reveal Josaphat’s divorce was finalized that day. Records show that woman has remarried lately.</p><p>The affidavit states that Josaphat told deputies he planned to take his daughter to breakfast that morning. He arrived at the property and noticed someone installing a surveillance camera by the front entrance and “anger took over him.”</p><p>The girl may not have lived at the house where the incident occurred.</p><p>Josaphat said he placed his 17-round pistol magazine into his Glock 17 and chambered a bullet as he approached the property, the affidavit states.</p><p>According to the affidavit, a woman was bringing groceries inside from her car trunk. As she carried groceries to her front door, Josaphat asked her a question she didn’t answer.</p><p>According to deputies, Josaphat said “good morning” to them and they did too. He allegedly pulled out a revolver and shot them both, then continued to shoot more times. According to the affidavit, Josaphat said he shot one in the upper body and head and the other many times.</p><p>The affidavit says his daughter saw the entire shooting.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismKm%2ForrQrqacrJ%2BWu62twp2sqKaXY7KlwY2vpWienKS%2FqrDAZqSapl2ovK%2FFjKOmrJmgna61ecOroK%2Bdo2K1qrnSnqOfZaSkequtyKVkmp6kmr9ut8ilo6Kml2K7psPLsq6enKNivLbA0qKbnmWknbKqvoyhpqadXZ67brzApaRmmpWWsKl5xaWmq6GUlnw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogInfo - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
