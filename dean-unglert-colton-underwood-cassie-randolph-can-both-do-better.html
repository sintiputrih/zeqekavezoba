There’s one line in The Office&nbsp;where I think Jim and Pam started dating and Dwight says, ‘I think they both can do better.’ I think that kind of applies to Cassie and Colton,” Unglert, 29, exclusively told Us Weekly on Monday, August 17, while promoting his and <a href=#><strong>Jared Haibon</strong></a>’s live <a href=#>virtual “Help! I Suck at Dating” podcast</a>. “I obviously want the best for them and I don’t know exactly what’s going on.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Dean-Unglert-Says-Colton-Underwood-and-Cassie-Randolph-Can-Do-Better-Post-Split.jpg><p>Randolph, 25, and Underwood, 28, met during his season of <a href=#>The Bachelor</a> and dated for nearly two years before calling it quits in May. However, they’re now in a good place.</p><p>“I have nothing but good things and love and well-wishes and <a href=#>friendship with Cassie right now</a>. I love the girl and miss the girl dearly,” the former Bachelor said on the “Reality Steve” podcast on Thursday, August 13. “She’s amazing.”</p><p>The First Time author also shared <a href=#>that he’s “happily single” right now</a>. “My next relationship I’m already in and that’s with myself,” he said during a Chat4Good panel on August 11. “I’ve decided that I want to spend my energy and focus on all my attention on myself, which I’m actually weirdly loving. It sounds so crazy [and] so weird.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Caelynn-Miller-Keyes-and-Dean-Unglert-Says-Colton-Underwood-and-Cassie-Randolph-Can-Do-Better-Post-Split.jpg><p>Unglert, for his part, has been dating Miller-Keyes, 25, ever since the pair met on season 6 of <a href=#>Bachelor in Paradise</a> in 2019. Although they’re not engaged yet, <a href=#>they do wear rings to show their commitment</a> to one another. If they did want to get married, it would “be more of a party,” he told Us.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I would just invite a bunch of my friends over and we’d get really drunk. We’d all tell a bunch of great stories and laugh and cry and that would be the day,” he said. “It’s something that wouldn’t necessarily be as traditional — basically just a celebration of friendship and love and all these things with a bunch of our friends and family around. Really, that’s all we’ve really ever asked for.”</p><p>Unglert and Jared Haibon’s “Help! I Suck at Dating” live virtual podcast takes place Tuesday, August 18, at 8:30 p.m. ET. <a href=#>Tickets are available on Tixr.com</a> for $10.</p><p>With reporting by Christina Garibaldi</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGadnZGjera6xqWcq6xdmLytwM6nZK6mlJq%2FuLvOnWScmaOotqZ50ZqlnaecpbVur8CnZJunpJ16pbuMm5ytrJWnfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogInfo - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
