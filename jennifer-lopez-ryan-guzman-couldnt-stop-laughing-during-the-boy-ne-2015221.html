After squashing dating rumors, <strong>Jennifer Lopez</strong> and <strong>Ryan Guzman</strong>, currently starring in thriller The Boy Next Door, out Jan. 23, revealed to <a href=#><strong>HuffPost Live</strong> </a>that filming the movie’s raunchiest scene wasn’t quite as sexy as it seemed.</p><p>In The Boy Next Door, Lopez plays Claire, a recently separated high school teacher whose brief tryst with her next door neighbor (and student!) leads to a dangerous obsession. Guzman, who plays the 19-year-old “boy” in question, Noah, said that Lopez, 45, guided him when filming the film’s sexiest scene.</p><p>“This is probably the racier of the scenes that I’ve ever done on-screen. I think, for me, that scene in this particular movie is really important because it’s the one moment that they share together that propels the rest of the action of the film,” said the “Booty” singer. “It had to be intense, it had to be impactful.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>“[Noah] definitely knew what he was doing… that was the catalyst of why he would turn… he caught her at a very weak moment and exploited it,” said Guzman, 27. The steamy encounter comes early in the movie, and serves as a launching point for what becomes an unhealthy obsession.</p><p>“[Lopez] was the one that told me how important the scene was, and just to get out of your own head, and just to have fun with each other…” Guzman, who previously starred in Step Up Revolution and Step Up All In, said, laughing. “Let me clarify… be relaxed!”&nbsp;</p><p>The costars did agree that filming a sex scene can be incredibly uncomfortable — especially when surrounded by cameras and crew members.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“We couldn’t stop laughing at one point because you feel so awkward,” said the mom of two.</p><p>“Just in general, I think it was so well shot, and the final project is just so amazing,” said Guzman. “You leave feeling something, and that’s what we intended to do.”&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Their chemistry on-screen is so believable, it sparked real-life romance rumors after the pair attended the Golden Globes together to promote the soon-to-be released film.</p><p>“[Lopez] knows how to handle it with elegance, for me it was like ‘Why is everybody asking all these questions?’ No one was interested in me not even a couple months ago… it’s crazy,” Guzman laughed. “Now that I’m starting to get notoriety and now that we’re hanging out and having fun and just enjoying each other’s time while promoting the film, people are speculating and creating their own stories for us, without us even speaking!”</p><p>Have a question you’d like to ask a celebrity?
