Elordi just has a certain je ne sais quoi, mixed with an astonishingly weird personality that we can’t get enough of. Or it may be the fact that he’s particularly good looking.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=379 data-current-count=379 data-injectable=false>You likely know him from a few places. For quite some time, the actor was known for his highly despised Euphoria character, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">but after Priscilla and Saltburn</a>, we finally saw the potential within this gentle-looking giant. Worthy of getting the Robert Pattison treatment, we should all just forget <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">that he was in The Kissing Booth</a> – he’s now reaching for the sun and stars.</p><p data-characters=308 data-current-count=687 data-injectable=true>Regardless of the hundreds of interviews he’s been doing, there is one particularly striking feature that has been traveling in anyone’s mind – <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">and no, I’m not talking about his height</a>. Instead, his accent is one of the many things wooing people in, so let’s unravel that, shall we?</p><h2 id=h-where-is-jacob-elordi-from data-injectable=false>Where is Jacob Elordi from?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Saltburn-movie.jpg><p data-characters=377 data-current-count=677 data-injectable=true>Elordi is actually neither British nor American. The actor was born in Brisbane, Australia, and only recently did he come all the way to Hollywood. In fact, the actor grew up in Australia and even started his career in the Oceania country. His first role was in the Australian film Swinging Safari in 2018, and from then on out, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">he began conquering all corners of planet Earth</a>.</p><p data-characters=407 data-current-count=407 data-injectable=false>Nonetheless, a lot of his repertoire is now situated in the United States, and he even played one of the country’s most emblematic (albeit contentious) stars: Elvis Presley. He could’ve fooled all of us <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">with that perfect Elvis accent</a> that had us eating from his hand. After all, no one could’ve guessed that after Nathan and Elvis, Elordi’s real accent would actually be Australian.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S2tHnJmpqoml2aubC%2Bw6Jkm6qZqba0tIyapayvlaeypXs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogInfo - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
