The talented singer is married to a supportive dude. Here's what you need to know about Grant Savoy.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>In 2021, country star <a href=#>Mickey Guyton</a> hosted the ACM Awards (along with Keith Urban), marking the first time a Black female artist had co-hosted the show. The ACM Awards have been striving harder to make the show more inclusive, as the <a href=#>country genre</a> unfortunately has the tendency to give predominantly white artists the spotlight.</p><p>While fans are undoubtedly familiar with her hit, "Black Like Me," they might not know a ton about the My Kind of Country mentor's personal life. Does Mickey have a husband? Let's take a closer look at her relationship.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is Mickey Guyton's husband?</h2><p>Mickey Guyton's husband is lawyer Grant Savoy, and the two got married in June 2017. Grant was born in 1983 in Kauai, Hawaii, went to college at California State University, Northridge, and then went on to study Criminal Law at Southwestern University of Law. He's one of the founding members of the law firm Solouki.</p><p>Mickey and Grant met through Mickey's best friend (who happens to be Grant's stepsister) back in 2010, and they've been a dream couple since.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram/@mickeyguyton</span></figure><p>Mickey and Grant welcomed the first child in February 2021, a baby boy named Grayson. "The hardest and most beautiful thing I have ever done. Welcome to the world Grayson!" Mickey wrote on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a>, introducing Grayson to the world.</p><p>Mickey is, for obvious reasons, totally obsessed with their bundle of cuteness. "I can literally just stare at him all day. I can’t believe I’m a mom. I can’t believe God gave me this human to look after forever," she wrote on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a>, sharing a photo of her son in a onesie.</p><p>Mickey doesn't get too personal about her relationship with Grant, but she's shared some beautiful photos of the couple that show their love is clearly everlasting. In June 2022, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mickey wrote</a>, "Happy Father’s Day to the best dad, husband, friend and my number one supporter! Grayson and I love you so much!"</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Mickey Guyton (@mickeyguyton)</a></p></figure><p>Back in 2017, Mickey <a href=# rel=nofollow>talked to Taste of Country</a> about the thought process behind her gorgeous Hawaii-based wedding. "Having a big wedding is really not my thing, so when my family decided on a vacation to Kauai, I thought, ‘Why not let it be a family vacation turned wedding? It was absolutely gorgeous! My husband has family from Kauai so it was important to him to have a luau at the wedding reception," she said. The intimate wedding only had 23 guests.</p><p>And while their marriage isn't perfect, it's pretty close. In 2019, Mickey wrote a beautiful ode to Grant on Instagram, saying,</p>"We love. We fight. When it’s tough we cry. We slam doors. There are times when we think we can’t do this anymore. But we choose. We choose to love each other through it all each and everyday. Marriage isn’t easy and it sure as hell ain’t pretty. But finding someone to love you through all the bull s**t is one of the most beautiful things you can ever experience."<figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Mickey Guyton (@mickeyguyton)</a></p></figure><p>She continued: "When this man walked into my life I was broken. I put him through hell because I was so hurt. But he persisted and loved me through all of my imperfections and transgressions. He put me on a pedestal that I didn’t think I deserved and showed me I was worth it. He now gives me the courage to be the human and artist that I was always meant to be."</p><p>Sounds like they're pretty lucky to have each other.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhforakt8SyZKCtqam8r3nHrqqbmZ6Z</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogInfo - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
