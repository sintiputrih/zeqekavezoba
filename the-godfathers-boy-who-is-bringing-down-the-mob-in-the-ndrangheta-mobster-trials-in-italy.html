class=mol-para-with-font><span class=mol-style-italic>By Rachael Bunyan for MailOnline</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Three judges assigned to oversee&nbsp;Italy’s largest mafia trial in more than 30 years today asked to be&nbsp;recused on the first day – as&nbsp;hundreds of alleged members of the ‘Ndrangheta mob prepared to face justice.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The trial, which is expected to take at least a year to complete, will involve 355 defendants, 400 lawyers and 900 witnesses alleging crimes from murder, drug trafficking and extortion, to money laundering and abuse of office.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Among the accused are suspected Mafia boss Luigi Mancuso, known as ‘The Uncle’, and his alleged accomplices who have a host of nicknames including&nbsp;<span>‘The Wolf’, ‘Fatty’, ‘Sweetie’, ‘Blondie’, ‘Little Goat’ and ‘The Wringer’.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>However, the initial hearing hit an immediate snag today after the three judges assigned to the case asked to be recused,&nbsp;saying they had been involved in earlier aspects of the investigation.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Their request will be reviewed by a separate court, which will delay proceedings for several days, lawyers said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Prosecutors claim the gang infiltrated almost every aspect of life in Italy’s Calabria region, from city hall and hospitals, to cemeteries and even the courts – while their empire also spanned the globe from Australia to Canada, and Germany to the US where it did business with El Chapo’s Sinaloa Cartel.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>An ex-senator from former premier Silvio Berlusconi’s Forza Italia party, Giancarlo Pittelli, is also among the list of defendants after he was&nbsp;accused of being middleman between the ‘Ndrangheta and the world of politics, banking, and other powerful institutions.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>At the centre of it all is Nicola Gratteri, 62, Italy’s top mafia prosecutor who defied threats that he is a ‘dead man walking’ as he strode into court on Wednesday.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Gratteri, who has spent the last 30 years living under police escort, said it was an ‘important day’, telling reporters outside court that the trial would ‘give the idea of what the Calabrian mafia is today – no longer a mafia of shepherds dedicated to kidnapping, but a major criminal corporation’.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He added: ‘Decades ago, people would tremble when talking about Cosa Nostra or when using the word ‘Ndrangheta, something they would say only in a hidden room, around the fireplace, whispering.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘Today we are beginning to speak out in the open sunlight.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘In the last two years, we can say we have been seeing a spike in complaints by businessmen, bullied citizens, victims of usury, people who for years have been subject to the pall of the ‘Ndrangheta,’ Graterri, who who has spent more than 30 years fighting the mob, added.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He later sat in the front row of the courtroom as Judge Tiziana Macri began reading out the names of the defendants, none of whom attended in person but who participated via video conference, their faces shown on dozens of televisions fitted over lines of grey desks.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The first three hours of the trial’s opening day were consumed by the court’s formal rollcall of the defendants and their lawyers.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Among the defendants are boss&nbsp;Luigi Mancuso ‘The Uncle’ and others with nicknames including ‘The Wolf’, ‘Fatty’, ‘Sweetie’, ‘Blondie’, ‘Little Goat’ and ‘The Wringer’.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Defendants who are jailed, due to convictions in other cases, could follow the proceedings by a video conference.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The trial, expected to last at least a year and likely longer, features 355 defendants, more than 900 prosecution witnesses, and an unprecedented number of collaborators, given the close family ties within the ‘Ndrangheta that discourage turncoats.&nbsp;</p><p>&lt;!—-><span

class=mol-para-with-font>Unlike some mafia factions, the ‘Ndrangheta has no compunction about murdering women and children, either.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Over the years they have killed them by the dozen. The victims included three-year-old Nicola Campolongo, who was shot in the head in 2014 after her grandfather had fallen foul of the Mob.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In 2012, six gang members were jailed for torturing and shooting Lea Garofalo, 35, a clan member’s girlfriend who had shared their secrets with the police, then dissolving her body in acid.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The court heard how they kept watch on the 50-litre acid vat in a rural warehouse for three days to make sure her corpse had been completely liquefied.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Two other female informants were forced to drink cups of acid and died in agony.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The 438 indictments levelled in this trial range from drugs and weapons trafficking to extortion. It took more than three hours last Wednesday just to read them out.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>That many of the accused shared surnames — there were 18 members of the Bianco family, for example — said much about the group’s insularity.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Only those with blood ties are admitted, and the estimated 10,000 members of the ‘Ndrangheta — which risibly translates as ‘Men of Honour’ — belong to about 100 Calabrian clans.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The defendants span the generations, and 44 are female. As Signor Gratteri told us, pitiless women play an essential role.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘They are involved in drug trafficking. They go back and forth from prisons, receiving orders, and now they have started (running) the rackets, too,’ he says.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The defendants have nicknames such as Big Nose, Fatty, Blondie, The Wolf, Little Goat, Sweetie, Leg of Lamb and The Wringer.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>If these sobriquets make them sound like characters from The Sopranos, the darkly comedic 1990s television mafia series that is attracting a new audience of locked-down British viewers, there is nothing remotely funny about their alleged activities.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>According to reports in Italy, when one female farmer refused to surrender her citrus orchard to the ‘Ndrangheta, her son was killed by a car bomb.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>And a businesswoman who vanished four years ago after defying the mob’s attempts to seize her land was murdered and fed to pigs, a clan member has allegedly confessed.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>It is not known whether examination of these horrors will feature in the showpiece trial, the logistics of which are staggering.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Before the pandemic, the 355 defendants — plus some 90 others who have opted for a separate, fast-track hearing — would have appeared in person.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>There would also have been 600 lawyers, 900 witnesses and a phalanx of international journalists — which meant converting a disused call centre the size of a football pitch, with 1,000 seats and capacious cages for the alleged mobsters.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Now, because of Covid, they will follow proceedings in the vast bunker via video links from their cells.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The makeshift courtroom is in the city of Lamezia Terme, an ‘Ndrangheta stronghold, so it has been fortified.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>This week, soldiers patrolled outside and a police helicopter buzzed overhead.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>At the heart of the investigation are the Mancuso family, who were impoverished farmers a century ago.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>According to Professor Antonio Nicaso, an authority on the mafia, their fortunes were transformed in the 1970s when they commandeered a big quarry.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The stone from it was used to build one of Europe’s biggest seaports, on the Tyrrhenian coast.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>During mafia infighting for lucrative contracts at the port, Gioia Tauro, about a thousand people were killed and the murder rate outstripped that of New York.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Signor Gratteri says: ‘The family is really low-key.
