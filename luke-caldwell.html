Meanwhile, on December 8, 2020, he will celebrate his 42nd birthday with his wife and children. His zodiac sign is Sagittarius, according to his birth date.</p><h2><span id=Luke_Caldwell_Family_Religion_and_Band>Luke Caldwell Family, Religion, and Band</span></h2><p>Even though Luke rarely speaks about his family in public, he has always admired his father. According to Luke Caldwell, his father believes in the power of prayer and service to others.</p><p>Luke expressed his appreciation and admiration for his father in a Facebook post on Father’s Day in 2015. Luke described his father as the closest thing he had ever seen to Jesus Christ. Luke ended the touching post by expressing his gratitude for having a father like him.</p><p>Luke, like his father, is a religious man. In fact, it was their shared faith and belief in something grand and divine that brought Luke and his best friend Clint together. Though Luke regards him as a professional designer now, he had no intention of pursuing a career in design when he began his career. Music was something he breathed and felt as a child.</p><p>For a long time, he was a member of the Idaho-based band Esterline. Luke was a member of two of the five albums released by the band Esterline.</p><h2><span id=Luke_Caldwell8217s_Height_and_Tattoos>Luke Caldwell’s Height and Tattoos</span></h2><p><strong>Luke Caldwell, a former professional musician, stands a towering 6 feet tall. Similarly, he does not weigh more than 80 kilograms.</strong></p><p>He has brown hair and brown eyes, which are his distinguishing features. Luke also has at least one tattoo on one of his hands.</p><h2><span id=Social_Media_Instagram_Facebook_and_Twitter><span class="TextRun SCXW229505167 BCX8" lang=en-us xml:lang=EN-US data-contrast=auto><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW229505167 BCX8" data-ccp-parastyle="heading 2">Social Media: Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter</span></span><span class="EOP SCXW229505167 BCX8" data-ccp-props='{"201341983":0,"335559738":40,"335559739":0,"335559740":259}'>&nbsp;</span></span></h2><p>Luke has a sizable social media following for a designer and reality TV star. As of February 2021, the Idaho native can be found on Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter.</p><p>While Instagram is where Luke spends the majority of his time, the designer has a sizable following on other platforms as well. Luke had 165 thousand Instagram followers, 20 thousand Facebook followers, and 1.8 thousand Twitter followers as of this writing.</p><h2><span id=Was_he_a_contestant_on_Restaurant_Impossible>Was he a contestant on Restaurant: Impossible?</span></h2><p>Aside from Boise Boys, Luke Caldwell has also appeared as a designer on Food Network’s Restuarant: Impossible. Since a failing restaurant must be restored and redesigned for profitability and prominence in Restuarant: Impossible, a designer is also required.</p><p>Though it was decided that Luke would only appear on one episode of Restaurant: Impossible as a designer, he received such positive feedback that he was hired to do many more.</p><h2><span id=Luke_Caldwell8217s_Boise_Boys_Timber_And_Love>Luke Caldwell’s Boise Boys, Timber, And Love</span></h2><p>Luke’s fans are already aware of the Boise Boys star’s heart for adoption, and it was this love that led him to become a designer and real estate, investor. Luke made his first real estate investment, purchasing a run-down house because an adopted family required more space than a local musician could afford.</p><p>In 2015, Luke met Clint, a man who shared his passion for renovation and design. The couple quickly established their own company, Timber and Love, and began renovating houses. Luke and Clint nailed their first renovation as a business partner.</p><p>Luke co-starred with Clint in HGTV’s Boise Boys in 2017. The Flipping Across America star excels at home design, and his best friend Clint secures some of the most lucrative contracts. As a result, Luke and Clint are unquestionably a force to be reckoned with.</p><h2><span id=What_is_the_Net_worth_of_Luke_Caldwell><span class="TextRun BCX8 SCXW155705740" lang=en-us xml:lang=EN-US data-contrast=none><span class="NormalTextRun BCX8 SCXW155705740">What is the Net worth of Luke Caldwell?</span></span><span class="EOP BCX8 SCXW155705740" data-ccp-props='{"201341983":0,"335559739":160,"335559740":259}'>&nbsp;</span></span></h2><p><strong>In addition, Luke Caldwell’s net worth is estimated to be around $1 million.</strong></p><p><b><span data-contrast=auto>Luke Caldwell estimated Net Worth</span></b><span data-contrast=auto>, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles & many more details have been updated below.
