The tweet was dated December 7, 2021, during the shooting of RHOBH Season 12. Minkoff revealed her battles with ED in the latest episode. Richards then recounted her bulimia tale from when she was younger. The three women wrapped up their chat with tears in their eyes and heartfelt embraces.</p><h2>Crystal Kung Minkoff’s eating disorder</h2><p>Bulimia, also known as bulimia nervosa, is a severe eating condition that may be fatal. According to the Mayo Clinic, bulimia is defined as follows:</p><p>“People with bulimia may surreptitiously binge — consume big quantities of food without control — and then purge, attempting to get rid of the additional calories in an unhealthy manner.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Crystal-Kung-Minkoff-1.jpeg alt="Crystal Kung Minkoff" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Crystal alerted her followers through Instagram that she will discuss her health on RHOBH Season 12 Episode 11. The post stated:</p><p>“I’m going to start talking about my eating issue tonight.” While the event and presumably reliving it were both difficult, it is not something I am embarrassed of or feel defines who I am. It’s a part of me; a live issue I encounter on a daily basis.”</p><p>It went on:</p><p>“If you are suffering, please remember that you do not have to heal alone.” Support is accessible whether you seek out to a family member, friend, teacher, coach, mentor, workplace, professional, helpline, or anyone else you feel comfortable talking to.”</p><h2>In the latest RHOBH episode, what advice did Erika Jayne provide to Crystal Minkoff?</h2><p>Crystal Minkoff was seen discussing her ED with Garcelle Beauvais and Erika Jayne at Diana’s home party in RHOBH Season 12 Episode 11. She said that she suffers around the holidays since they include a lot of food.&nbsp;When Erika Jayne advised that Minkoff use laxatives, the discussion quickly became unpleasant. Beauvais and Minkoff both appeared stunned. Beauvais confessed in a confessional:</p><p>“Is it a laxative?” She suffers from an eating disorder! Erika is not a doctor, and you don’t provide laxatives to someone suffering from an eating issue. It’s really the most inconvenient thing at the most inconvenient moment.”</p><p>After Jayne continued to interrogate Minkoff about her health, the latter questioned whether Jayne was attempting to assist or if she was just inebriated. Jayne asked for another drink after mocking Minkoff about her eating condition, and the program ended on a cliffhanger.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Crystal-Kung-Minkoff-2.jpg alt="Crystal Kung Minkoff" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>According to the official description for Episode 11, titled The Weight of Words:</p><p>“Dorit fangirls over Jamie Lee Curtis, who is a special guest at Kyle’s charity luncheon; an eye-opening social media post draws attention to Crystal; and Sutton realizes that some friendships aren’t meant to be.”</p><p>Jamie Lee Curtis appeared as a guest star in the most recent episode. It also saw Sutton Stracke and Diana Jenkins settling their prior episode fight. Kathy Hilton, Kyle Richards’ sister, made a triumphant comeback to the program in Episode 11.&nbsp;More drama may be seen on Bravo the next week. The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills Season 12 Episode 12 will premiere on Wednesday, July 27, 2022 at 8 p.m.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGipoaeSnXq0wMCrZJyqqajBoriMpKynn12itq%2B3zp%2BdZqugpLimedSpZJqan6rBbrTEq2SemaSeu6h5w6KqqKqUmr9w</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogInfo - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
