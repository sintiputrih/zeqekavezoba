Obviously More Than 1</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><p>Since the Bravo series “The Real Housewives of Atlanta” debuted in 2008, NeNe Leakes has been a fun character. With her snappy one-liners, no-nonsense demeanor, and well-known clapbacks, the opinionated reality star rapidly won over audiences. Leakes continues to score well among the most recognizable housewives of all time, despite her recent separation with Bravo and “Housewives” creator Andy Cohen following her exit from “RHOA” (via Us Weekly). Of course, Leakes’ fame also stems from her acting career, which, according to IMDb, has featured roles in shows like “Glee,” “The New Normal,” and even Broadway.</p><p>Leakes has dabbled in business with endeavors like her former clothing line that was marketed on HSN and an Atlanta-based lounge; all of these have helped to increase Leakes’ enormous net worth. Leakes has achieved success, but her path hasn’t always been straightforward. She recently had to deal with the unfortunate death of her spouse Gregg in 2021 due to his cancer diagnosis. His former wife sued Leakes for aiding in the breakdown of her marriage when he moved on with Nyonisela Sioh, according to TMZ. Leakes had previously been arrested a number of times after having run-ins with the law.</p><h3>NeNe Leakes has been arrested four times</h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/nene-leakes-has-been-arrested-four-times-1675278567.jpg alt width=390 height=219 sizes="(max-width: 390px) 100vw, 390px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><br>Leakes was open and honest about many elements of her life while she was a cast member of “The Real Housewives of <a href=#>Atlanta</a>,” including her past as a dancer and difficulties in her marriage to Gregg Leakes. Leakes, though, was quite reticent when it came to her criminal history. Leakes mentioned one earlier arrest in her autobiography, according to a 2014 Daily Mail story. That wasn’t the whole tale, though. Leakes had actually been taken into custody three more times, as discovered by the magazine. These following arrests happened after Leakes allegedly broke the terms of her probation for theft and shoplifting-related offenses. Leakes used a now-deleted tweet to defend herself on Twitter after the news was published. “I was a single mother, lost, terrified, and trapped 22 years ago. I care about myself enough to change, and you can too!” (Thanks to BET) Leakes tweeted.</p><p>Of course, Leakes’ arrest record was used against her by Shereé Whitfield, another housewife. On “RHOA,” Whitfield brought up Leakes’ own criminal record after she had chastised her ex-partner for having a criminal past. Whitfield was then addressed by Leakes on “Saying, “I honestly don’t care about Shereé bringing up a mugshot on Watch What Happens Live… Ten years in prison for operating a Ponzi scam does not equal a mugshot. Okay, honey, I didn’t spend a day in jail doing nothing.”</p><h3>NeNe Leakes owns her past</h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/nene-leakes-owns-her-past-1675278567.jpg alt width=390 height=219 sizes="(max-width: 390px) 100vw, 390px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Although NeNe Leakes took a while to reveal her past criminal activity, she now has a completely different outlook. The reality celebrity in 2020 profited while mocking her past transgressions. How? Leakes, however, stated on Instagram that in 2020, shirts would be sold with her mugshot printed across the front.</p><p>Leakes stated on Instagram, “Growing up without my mother or father… caused me many growing pains, but without them, I could not be who I am or have attained the things that I have today. “Your future is not influenced by your past. From Trial to Triumph… I wish to encourage everyone to accept and not be ashamed of who they have become as a result of their past experiences. I appreciate your affection so much, everyone.” Leakes gushed about her second design option in a different Instagram post. Look out for the From MUGSHOTS to MILLIONS t-shirt launch this week, according to Leakes. It’s unclear how many of her fans bought shirts to show their support.</p><a class=m-a-box-avatar-url href=#><img width=150 height=150 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/logo-Finale.png alt itemprop=image style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><h5><a class=m-a-box-name-url href=#>DCS</a></h5><a href=# class=m-a-box-data-toggle><span class=m-a-box-string-more-posts>+ posts</span></a><p>Our Team DCS includes 5 different writers proficient in English and research based Content Writing.
