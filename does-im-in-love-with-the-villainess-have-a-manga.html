It likely won’t top the ranking of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">best Yuri anime ever</a>, no, but it’s still a worthwhile watch for those who wish to see more queer representation in the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">isekai genre</a>.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=533 data-current-count=533 data-injectable=true>As we know all too well by now, though, not all anime get to have their stories told in full. It’s understandable in an industry such as this, with so much content to explore and new series getting released day in and day out. Unless it’s a smashing success with audiences — like your typical shonen hits — new seasons of your favorite anime are never guaranteed. Perhaps because of that, many folks resort to manga. (Or maybe they simply cannot wait for however long it might take to see the story unfold on screen.)</p><p data-characters=235 data-current-count=235 data-injectable=false>Whatever the reason may be, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">I’m in Love with the Villainess‘ anime debut</a> has gotten viewers interested in checking out the source material.
