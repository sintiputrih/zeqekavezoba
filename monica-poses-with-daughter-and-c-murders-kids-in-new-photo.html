The celebrity mom performed onstage and took pictures with her daughter, Laiyah Brown, and C-Murder’s daughters – Coco, Alexis, and Chanelle – backstage.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bckonline.com/elements/uploads/2021/12/monica2.jpg alt width=640 height=800 sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><a href=#>Monica</a> gave a tribute to C-Murder while performing her set last Friday. The crowd led the singer into the dedication by chanting, “Free C-Murder.” Monica followed the vibe by singing her classic hit, ‘For You I Will,’ in which she inserted C-Murder’s name in the song.</p><p>C-Murder took to Instagram after the show give praises to Monica. “My baby kilt (sic) it at the show,” the rapper wrote online. “Her sanging (sic) this outfit a #TRUqueen,” C-Murder continued. “We knew from Day 1 this was real love. No opinion changes a fact and we got the history to prove that. If you know me you know how I’m coming ’bout her.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bckonline.com/elements/uploads/2021/12/monica4.jpg alt width=640 height=800 sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><a href=#>Monica</a> and C-Murder dated several years ago. The ‘Angel Of Mine’ singer recently rallied to get Kim Kardashian involved with her good friend’s legal case, which has discrepancies that could lead to his release from prison. C-Murder was convicted and sentenced to life in prison for the murder of 16-year-old Steven Thomas in 2009.</p><p>The recording artist was found liable for the teen’s death. Two key witnesses in the case, however, refuted their testimonies and admitted that police and prosecutors pressured them into indicating C-Murder as the guilty party. C-Murder has always maintained his innocence and even called his brother, Master P, out for allegedly failing to support him through the entire process.</p><p><a href=#>Master P</a> recently took to social media to refute accusations of abandonment. The businessman told his supporters that he consistently visited his brother in prison while also providing financial support to C-Murder and other members of the family. Master P concluded his video by telling fans that he would no longer support his extended family to the degree that he once gave help.</p><p>Chanelle Miller started the “Free Corey Miller” petition, which has garnered nearly 19,000 of the 25,000 needed signatures to date.
