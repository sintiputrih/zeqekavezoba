Murphy’s death.</span></p><p>After Joseph C. Murphy completed the excruciating Bataan Death March, he eventually arrived at the notorious Japanese Cabanatuan POW Camp #1 in the Nueva Ecija Province.</p><p>The camp lacked proper food and water resources, leading to widespread starvation, malnutrition, and disease. When the camp was liberated in 1945, an estimated 2,800 Americans had died at Cabanatuan. Unfortunately, 20-year-old Joseph C. Murphy was one of the deceased.</p><p>On October 28, 1942, Murphy died as a result of malnutrition and dysentery. He was buried in Common Grave 713 at the Cabanatuan Camp Cemetery.</p><p>Murphy’s family members were notified of his death and given a letter from U.S. General Douglas MacArthur.</p><p>“My deepest sympathy goes to you in the death of your son, Pfc. Joseph C. Murphy, while a prisoner of war of the enemy,” General MacArthur wrote, according to <a href=# rel=noopener>newspaper clips</a> collected by the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency.</p><p>After the war was over, officials attempted to identify his remains, but since he had been buried with other prisoners and the men’s remains had decomposed over time, it proved difficult to figure out which remains belonged to which men. The recent exhumation — and modern DNA analysis — meant that Murphy could finally be found.</p><p>Now, Murphy’s remains are scheduled to arrive back home in Bogalusa, Louisiana, where they will be buried properly on August 3, 2024.</p><p>After reading about Joseph C.
