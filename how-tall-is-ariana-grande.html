But the singer famously lives in high heels, and her on-screen appearances, both in videos and elsewhere, often use clever angles that can be misleading at best. So, how does the singer actually stack up in real life?</p>Recommended Videos<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>ariana grande be like:</p><p>█ █ █<br>█ █ █<br>█ █ █<br>█ █ █ █<br>talent beauty voice height</p>— jas. (@sweetfvntasy) <a href=#>July 19, 2021</a></figure><p data-characters=290 data-current-count=590 data-injectable=true>One reason for the confusion around the singer’s height is almost certainly her preference for high-heeled and platform shoes. She seems to have about as much self-control when it comes to buying platform heels as she does when it comes to adopting dogs (she has 8. Dogs, not shoes).</p><p data-characters=282 data-current-count=282 data-injectable=false>According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Footwear News</a>, the singer not only regularly performs in six-inch heels, she even walks around Disneyland in them. “After her show in Anaheim, we went to Disneyland, and she still walked around in six-inch heels. Those feet are magical.” said her stylist Law Roach.</p><p data-characters=174 data-current-count=456 data-injectable=true>“I think there’s something wrong with me, for sure,” Grande told Footwear News but added “If you wanted me to I could, like, run. I mean, I can get to A to B fast.”</p><h2 id=h-ariana-grande-s-approximate-height data-injectable=false>Ariana Grande’s approximate height</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Ariana Grande (@arianagrande)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=421 data-current-count=721 data-injectable=true>Sources around the web don’t seem to have a firm handle on the singer’s real measurements either. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">IMDb</a> puts the singer down as 5-feet-half-an-inch,&nbsp;while online celeb fact gatherer <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Cheatsheet</a> had her at a whole 5-foot-three-inches (which seems to be her max as far as suppositions go) based on Grande’s own Tweet that, unfortunately no longer exists — Grande deleted her Twitter in December of 2021.</p><p data-characters=401 data-current-count=401 data-injectable=true>The truth appears to be somewhere in between: maybe a bit taller than IMDb would put it and maybe a bit shorter than her deleted Tweet. Looking at pictures of Grande with her former boyfriend Big Sean, and her <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ex-husband, Dalton Gomez</a>, both of whom clock in at 5-foot-8-inches AND accounting for the heels she may be wearing, it seems as if Grande is roughly between 5-foot-1-inch and 5-foot-2-inches.</p><p data-characters=276 data-current-count=276 data-injectable=false>Grande confirmed a height of 5-foot-2-inches during an interview on the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Zach Sang Show</a>. When asked about her habit of performing regularly in high heels, The Voice judge responded, “I don’t have a choice. I’m, like, 5…5. I‘m just five. Nah, I’m 5-foot-2-inches.″</p><p data-characters=235 data-current-count=511 data-injectable=false>Given the former stated height of 5-foot-3-inches, we think the lowball 5-foot-2-inches is probably the truth. Grande has been very vocal about her thoughts on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">people commenting on her body</a>, so her secrecy is perfectly understandable.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S1sMOMrZilpF2ewG6t0aKYp5ldnL%2BiusOeZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogInfo - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
