Throughout his career, he has made rounds for his sportsmanship, as well as his relationships. There’s significantly more buzz around the Kansas City Chiefs tight end yet again. This time, it’s because there’s a rumored <a href=# rel>romance brewing between him and Taylor Swift</a>. This is following a long on-and-off relationship with his ex-girlfriend, Kayla Nicole.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, due to renewed public interest in the sportsman’s personal life, Nicole is also under the spotlight once again. Their breakup last year was heavily publicized as well. Firstly, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Travis Kelce is still tight-lipped</a> about a romantic connection to <a href=# class=text-word rel>Taylor Swift</a>, but the rumors and speculations are growing by the day. Secondly, Travis Kelce seems to be moving on quite well from his last relationship. However, so is Kayla Nicole. In fact, <a href=# rel>Nicole has gained the attention of Rick Ross</a>, who was recently noticed in the model’s comment section. There’s not been as much coverage of Nicole since the two broke up, but the fashion influencer and journalist is still relatively known.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Read More: <a href=# rel>Kayla Nicole Net Worth 2023: What Is The Fitness Influencer Worth?</a></strong></p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Kayla Nicole’s Background</h2></span><p>Born Kayla Brown on November 2, 1991, Kayla Nicole is a social media influencer, and on-air sports journalist. Her interests in sports and journalism grew into a passion that pushed her to pursue a career in the two. She has a Bachelor’s degree from Pepperdine University, where she graduated from in 2013. Subsequently, in 2018, she posted a video on Instagram, with the caption, “Friendly reminder I have a broadcast degree in journalism.” Nicole further stated that hosting is what she loves to do, and where her heart is.</p><p><strong>Read More: <a href=# rel>Travis Kelce & Taylor Swift Reportedly Paid To Clear Out Restaurant For Them & Chiefs Players</a></strong></p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What Does Kayla Nicole Do?</h2></span><p>Kayla Nicole has been involved in various parts of the entertainment industry over the years. She has worked as a model and participated in many beauty pageants growing up. Although she is a considerably successful model, her passion still lies within sports and journalism. Despite being an ambassador for Savage X Fenty, Crocs, and Revolve, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">per People</a>, Nicole still works as an entertainment journalist.

(Photo by Michael Owens/Getty Images)</p><p>In 2016, Travis Kelce was dating Maya Benberry. The German-born actress emerged as the winner of the reality TV show, Catching Kelce. She was chosen by Kelce himself, and the two dated for eight months before splitting up in January 2017. Shortly after their separation, Travis Kelce began dating Kayla Nicole. Nicole previously shared on an Instagram story that they first interacted on Instagram. Their relationship soon transitioned from social media flirting to real-life romance.</p><p>The two were romantically involved for five years, between 2017 and 2022. During their time together, they split up a few times, but always got back together. There seems to be a sense of finality this time, however, as it’s been over a year since their last breakup. Evidently, the two have moved on and share little interest in rekindling their romance.</p><p><strong>Read More: <a href=# rel>Travis Kelce Tried And Failed To Give Taylor Swift His Number During Eras Tour</a></strong></p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-aftermath>The Aftermath</h2></span><p>Much like it was before her relationship with Kelce, Nicole’s love life is now private. She may, or may not have found someone else. The 31-year-old does not seem to be interested in sharing those details with the public. These days, she only gives glimpses into the not-so-personal parts of her life. Travis Kelce, on the other hand, seems to be moving on with the megastar, Taylor Swift. The two were filmed leaving the stadium together after a match Kelce had played in earlier. Over the last couple days, there have been speculations about the two being a couple. That is yet to be confirmed.</p><p>[<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">via</a>]</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdnZoVzg5Rmq6uZpp7AbrfEpZqeZZuWxq2tjKegnKecmg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogInfo - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
