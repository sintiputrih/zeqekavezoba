<span class=val><a href=./categories/blog>blog</a></span></div><h1 class=headline itemprop=headline>What is the flaw in Callandor?</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><span><span>Callandor is flawed because much like Vora's Sa'angreal (The one that Egwene uses in The Last Battle, and the White Tower Raid) <b>it does not have the buffer that keeps the user safe from taking too much of the power within them, or keeps them from being forced into linking/circles</b>.</span></span><h2>What is the white stone at the end of Wheel of Time?</h2>Moiraine gives Rand a special stone called the Sa'angreal. She tells him that when the time would come, Rand would be able to channel consciously and would be able to proliferate the power manifold with the help of the Sa'angreal.<h2>What is the Stone of Tear?</h2>The Stone of Tear is an immense fortress, believed to be mankind's oldest surviving stronghold and indeed oldest existing structure, having been erected shortly after, or during, the Breaking of the World.<h2>When did rand lose his hand?</h2>Knife of Dreams/Chapter 27.<h2>Who is Rand's father?</h2>Janduin was the clan chief of the Taardad Aiel of the Iron Mountain sept and the biological father of Rand al'Thor, the Dragon Reborn.<h2>RAND AL'THOR & CALLANDOR (The Wheel of Time)</h2><p></p><h2>Who is Rand's mother Wheel of Time?</h2>His mother was "Shaiel", which means "she who is dedicated" in the Old Tongue, a Wetlander that appeared in the Aiel Waste six years before Rand was born. His mother and father were never married, even after Shaiel fell pregnant, as she refused to give up the spear.<h2>Is elaida Black Ajah?</h2>She is revealed as Black Ajah by Doesine, Pevara, Saerin, Seaine and Yukiri when they force her to re-swear the three oaths. She claims that Elaida is also Black Ajah. Talene receives an order to appear before the Supreme Council, so Saerin hides her in a lower basement of the White Tower.<h2>Is Liandrin Black Ajah?</h2>Liandrin Guirale (pronounced: lee-AHN-drihn) is an Aes Sedai of the Red Ajah, and secretly a member of the Black Ajah.<h2>How old is Logain?</h2>Physical appearance. Logain is an adult man of about thirty.<h2>Who is the girl at the end of Wheel of Time?</h2>The finale sees the characters battle the same demons with which art has concerned itself for millennia. After realizing that he's the Dragon Reborn, Rand (Josha Stradowski) sets out with Aes Sedai Moiraine (Rosamund Pike) to meet the Dark One face-to-face at the Eye of the World.<h2>Can the true power break Cuendillar?</h2>Over the course of the series the Great Seals were shown to weaken, and some of them were found in pieces - something unprecedented in history. This is thought to be directly related to the Dark One's influence, because the True Power is apparently able to destroy cuendillar.<h2>Does Moiraine get her powers back in the books?</h2>In the sixth book of the Wheel of Time series, Lord of Chaos, Nynaeve discovered a new method of Healing which is effectively a cure for gentling and stilling. With it, she succeeded in restoring some of the characters' abilities to channel the One Power.<h2>How strong is Callandor?</h2>With callandor rand could "level a city with one blow". the most powerful explosion he can make unaided are akin to big conventional bombs, and leveling a city is a power akin to a nuclear bomb.<h2>Is Mat the Dragon?</h2>Let's not beat around the bush: in the books, Mat is not the Dragon Reborn. He's special, and there is something wrong with him, but he's not the one.<h2>Can Perrin turn into a wolf?</h2>Based on this, it does not seem dependent on age as the onset of channeling is. We do know, however, that Perrin's eyes transform to their wolf-like yellow a day or two after he talks to wolves for the first time but that meeting Elyas seemed to have no immediate effect.<h2>Is Egwene a dreamer?</h2>She is also the first Aes Sedai Dreamer to have been discovered since Corianin Nedeal, who died approximately 473 years prior to her rediscovery of this Talent; she is powerful enough to break out of an illusion orchestrated by Moghedien in the World of Dreams, which is no small feat, considering that Moghedien( ...<h2>Is Suroth a Darkfriend?</h2>The High Lady Suroth Sabelle Meldarath was a Seanchan noblewoman, the High Lady of Asinbayar and Barsabba. She fell in disgrace and is now da'covale. She is also a Darkfriend.<h2>Is Verin a dark friend?</h2>Verin next appears in the White Tower. To quickly gain Egwene's attention and gain a private meeting, she lies about the color of Egwene's dress. She then confirms that she is a member of the Black Ajah and that her Warder Tomas was a Darkfriend.<h2>Who married Egwene?</h2>Gawyn and Egwene are married in a simple ceremony orchestrated by Silviana Brehon. Gawyn is with Egwene when Egeanin Tamarath swears an oath to serve Egwene. He is with Egwene when she demands that Bryne actively include the Aes Sedai in his war-plans.<h2>What did elaida whisper to Rand?</h2>Elaida spoke again, barely moving her lips, so softly that [Rand] could barely hear her less than an arm's length away. "This, too, I Foretell. Pain and division come to the whole world, and this man stands at the heart of it. I obey the Queen," she whispered, "and speak it clearly."<h2>Who is the most powerful Aes Sedai?</h2>Nynaeve is the strongest Aes Sedai. However, among the Light siders, Alivia is far stronger and Sharina will become stronger. I would say that Alivia > Cyndane, instead of both tied at level 20 (Lanfear at 21).<h2>What is Moiraine secret?</h2>In truth, Moiraine was a wilder - her ability to channel manifested itself before she turned sixteen, and outside Aes Sedai guidance. She wisely kept this a secret until she could tell King Laman's Aes Sedai advisor; said advisor taught her for a short time before sending her to Tar Valon.<h2>Who is Rand's half brother?</h2>Lord Galadedrid of House Damodred, more commonly known as Galad, is the only son of Tigraine Mantear and Taringail Damodred and is the half-brother of Rand al'Thor through his mother, and of Elayne and Gawyn Trakand through his father.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye9ahmK1lmah6tbTEZp2lmaditq95wpqjpZmembyz</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogInfo - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
