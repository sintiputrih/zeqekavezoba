She discussed their dream date, ideal vacation and his favorite quirks of hers.</p><p>As she dived into a question about what he has learned from her, she initially believed his response would regard him being able to let go more. “It’s OK to be messy, be silly. I don’t know, that’s what I feel like,” the reality star said. “I feel like I brought out the kid in him.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Hannah-Brown-Answers-Questions-About-Boyfriend-Adam-Woolard.jpg><p>Brown was stunned by Woolard’s response as she said, “This is what he said [to] what’s something that Hannah’s taught you,<a href=#> ‘How to fall in love.’ … That’s so sweet.</a>”</p><p>The Alabama native, who called Woolard “the nicest person ever,” went on to dish about their first date. “He asked me out and it was a Mexican restaurant called Chulita,” she recalled. “We had margaritas.”</p><p>Reading off Woolard’s answer, he said that he “asked her out but it’s complicated.” She responded, “Wait, I don’t know why it’s complicated. [It is probably] because I’m the one who first, kind of, threw the line out there.”</p><p>Brown also shared Woolard’s first impression of her, which he wrote, “Effortlessly beautiful and vibrant and a little frantic, but so beautiful. Instant spark.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Hannah-Brown-Answers-Questions-About-Boyfriend-Adam-Woolard-2.jpg><p>The <a href=#>Dancing With the Stars</a> champion <a href=#>made her relationship with Woolard Instagram official</a> on Valentine’s Day with a photo of the pair kissing while on horseback. The confirmation came after the duo sparked dating rumors in January 2021 as <a href=#>they stepped out holding hands in Los Angeles</a>.</p><p>An insider recently told Us Weekly <a href=#>why Brown and Woolard make a “great match” for each other</a>. “They’re both from the South. He’s into working out, staying fit and enjoys doing a lot of sports: kickboxing, soccer, baseball, tennis — you name it,” the source revealed in January, noting that her love is both “nice” and “down-to-earth.”</p><p>Before landing on Woolard, the <a href=#>Bachelor</a> alum let fans in on her experiences with dating men whom she met through apps in November 2020. She also <a href=#>shared her ideal traits for a significant other</a>.</p><p>“I want a man, not a boy who just has their crap together, can be a rock and be, like, super supportive of me,” she said via YouTube at the time. “But also, right now, it doesn’t really matter. I just want a cute guy to hang out with and take me on a date. … Somebody [who] can buy my drinks, my food, my coffee. I like coffee dates. I’m more into that. I think, like, a surfing date would be fun. Skateboarding? I don’t know. I just want it to be very relaxed.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>After being eliminated from <a href=#><strong>Colton Underwood</strong></a>’s season of The Bachelor in 2019, Brown <a href=#>went on to become the season 15 Bachelorette</a> later that year. The former pageant queen was briefly engaged to contestant <a href=#><strong>Jed Wyatt</strong></a> but broke things off after learning that he entered the competition with a relationship. She then asked out runner-up<a href=#><strong> Tyler Cameron</strong></a> on a date, which they went on shortly before he began his brief fling with <a href=#><strong>Gigi Hadid</strong></a>.</p><p>Brown and Cameron, 28, wouldn’t reconnect until March 2020 when they quarantined together alongside his pals. <a href=#>They have since developed a strong bond as friends</a>.</p><p>“We have a great friendship,” the Florida native told Us in May 2020. “We both care about each other a lot and want each other to be happy. It was nice to kind of put our past behind us and be able to have that friendship again.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGahmZ6jrql5waumsKZdmbK1rcilqmaZlJa6bsPOqKOaqpRiv6a4wK2gqKajnbaxecinZK%2BhlJq8cA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogInfo - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
