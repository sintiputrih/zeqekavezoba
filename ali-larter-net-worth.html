She was also a part of “Final Destination”, “Final Destination 2”, and “Legally Blonde”. All of her efforts have helped put her net worth to where it is today.</p><p>How rich is Ali Larter? As of mid-2016, sources estimate a net worth that is at $8 million, mostly earned through a successful career as an actress. Aside from that, she is a model, and has appeared in many popular publications including Stuff, FHM, and Maxim.

From the age of 13, she was already doing modelling work and a few commercials. Eventually, she was signed by the Ford Modelling Agency which sent her to several countries including Japan, Italy, and Australia. She also met <a href=#>Amy Smart</a>, and the two would take acting classes together which would lead to their future careers.</p><p>Ali started making appearances in television shows such as “Chicago Hope”, and “Dawson’s Creek”. In 1999, she made her film debut in “Varsity Blues” alongside <a href=#>Amy Smart</a>, and the film would become a big success. This led to a lot more roles in teen movies including “Drive Me Crazy”, and horror films such as “House on Haunted Hill”. In 2000, she along with <a href=#>Devon Sawa</a> was cast in the film “Final Destination”, which is about teenagers who survive an accident but are stalked and killed by death; the film would become a huge success at the box office, leading Ali to her next opportunity in “Legally Blonde” alongside <a href=#>Reese Witherspoon</a>. The film was another success, and then Larter appeared in “American Outlaws” before trying her hand in the stage play “The Vagina Monologues”. She was then cast to appear in “Final Destination 2” which had mixed reviews, and then starred in “A Lot Like Love” alongside <a href=#>Ashton Kutcher</a>. All these appearances contributed to her net worth.</p><p>Ali was also beginning to appear in publications such as Maxim magazine, a further boost to her net worth.</p><p>In 2005, Ali moved back to Los Angeles and auditioned for the television show “Heroes”; the series featured characters that had superpowers, and she portrayed two characters in the show, which would go on and win several awards and would become a success until its cancellation in 2010 after four seasons. She would then go back to films, appearing in “Marigold”, the film based on a video game “Resident Evil: Extinction” in which she played Claire Redfield. In 2009, she had appeared in “Obsessed” alongside Idris Alba, portraying an aggressive co-worker and her performance would help it become successful. She then reprised her role of Claire Redfield in “Resident Evil: Afterlife”, which became her biggest hit at the box office, adding to her net worth and popularity. One of her latest projects is the final Resident Evil film “Resident Evil: The Final Chapter”.</p><p>Aside from acting, Larter has published her own cookbook entitled “Kitchen Revelry: A Year of Festive Menus from my Home to Yours”</p><p>For her personal life, it is known that she had a long term relationship with Hayes MacArthur and they eventually married in 2009.
