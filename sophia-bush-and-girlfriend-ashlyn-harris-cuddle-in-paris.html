Harris, meanwhile, opted for a gray blazer and denim jeans that she paired with a New York Yankees cap.</p><p class=p4>In one still, the soccer star wrapped her arm around Bush’s waist. In a second, she appeared to kiss Bush’s cheek while they stood on a balcony that overlooked the Eiffel Tower.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/1-Sophia-Bush-and-Girlfriend-Ashlyn-Harris-Cuddle-in-Paris.jpg><p class=p4>In another photo from the outing, the couple posed with actress <strong>Beanie Feldstein</strong>, composer<strong> Benj Pasek</strong> and TikTok star <strong>Dylan Mulvaney</strong>.</p><p class=p4>Bush and Harris have been linked since October 2023 following their respective splits from<strong> Grant Hughes</strong> and <strong>Ali Krieger</strong>. A <a href=#>source confirmed to <i>Us Weekly </i></a>at the time that Bush and Harris met at the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity the previous June and developed a friendship. After both of their marriages ended, Bush and Harris’ connection turned romantic. (Bush filed for divorce from Hughes, 42, in August 2023, two months before Harris <a href=#>filed to end her and Krieger’s marriage</a>.)</p><p class=p4>Bush, for her part, publicly came out as queer in April.</p><p class=p4>“As I came into myself, I already felt it was my home. I think I’ve always known that my sexuality exists on a spectrum,” she <a href=#>wrote in a <i>Glamour </i>essay</a>. “Right now I think the word that best defines it is queer. I can’t say it without smiling, actually. And that feels pretty great.”</p><p class=p4>Bush continued, “I sort of hate the notion of having to come out in 2024. But I’m deeply aware that we are having this conversation in a year when we’re seeing the most aggressive attacks on the LGBTQIA+ community in modern history. There were more than 500 anti-LGBTQIA+ bills proposed in state legislatures in 2023, so for that reason I want to give the act of coming out the respect and honor it deserves.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p4>According to Bush, coming out “finally [feels] like [she] can breathe.”</p><p class=p4>“I don’t think I can explain how profound that is. I feel like I was wearing a weighted vest for who knows how long,” Bush said at the time. “I hadn’t realized how heavy it was until I finally just put it down.”</p><p class=p4>Bush and Harris, who shares two kids with Krieger, made <a href=#>their red carpet debut</a> days later at the 2024 White House Correspondents’ Dinner.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGasp6CdtqJ5wa6qoWWRo7Fus8iro5%2BqmZq7pXnArJ%2BlsZ5itaK%2B0aKqZpulmbGtsYyipWaokae2tHs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogInfo - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
