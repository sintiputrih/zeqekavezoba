But this tiny, brave dog made a huge difference to his human soldiers during World War I.</p><p>As the story goes, members of the 102nd Infantry Regiment were in the middle of training at Yale University in 1917 when they noticed a puppy wandering nearby. Apparently a friendly stray, the little dog was taken in by Private J. Robert Conroy, who named him “Stubby” because of his stubby tail. The pup soon started training alongside the 102nd Infantry. He learned bugle calls and even how to raise his right paw to his eyebrow in a salute.</p><p>And when the troops shipped out to Europe to fight in World War I, they smuggled Stubby along with them.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-455823 alt="Stubby With General John J.

Stubby’s owner, Robert Conroy, is standing behind him in a suit.</span></p><p>He and the young men of the 102nd Infantry Regiment were quickly confronted with the terrifying reality of war. Machine guns rattled throughout the day, and choking mustard gas frequently rolled across the battlefields.</p><p>Stubby, though small, stepped up. He learned to sound the alarm about gas attacks, which saved soldiers who were sleeping, and he darted out into No Man’s Land to track down wounded men. The brave little dog even survived a shrapnel attack and once sniffed out a German spy who was attempting to draw a map of Allied trenches.</p><p>For this, Stubby was promoted to sergeant. He went on to shake paws with presidents, served as the official mascot of Georgetown University while Conroy studied there, and was given a half-page obituary in The New York Times when he died in 1926.</p><p>“Stubby took part in four major offensives, was wounded and gassed,” his <a href=# rel=noopener>New York Times obituary</a> read. “He captured a German Spy and won more medals than any other soldier dog. He led the American Legion parades and was known to three Presidents. He was, indisputably, a fighting dog.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufonynrcyorKxllKS0tHuV</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogInfo - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
