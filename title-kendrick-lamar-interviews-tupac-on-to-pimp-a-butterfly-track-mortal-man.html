The “interview” between the two artists was created using quotes from what <a href=#>GlobalGrind.com</a> reports was a 1994 interview between Tupac and Swedish music journalist, Mats Nileskär.</p><p>Towards the end of the musical portion of the Sounwave-produced song, Kendrick asks “I always wanted to ask you about a certain situation—about a metaphor actually. You spoke on the ground. What you mean by that? What the ground represent?”</p><p><a href=#>Tupac</a> then responds:</p><p>“The ground is gonna open up and swallow the evil. That’s how I see it. My word is bond. I see—And the ground is the symbol for the poor people. The poor people is gonna open up this whole world and swallow up the rich people. Cause the rich people gonna be so fat and they gonna be so appetizing. You know what I’m saying? Wealthy, appetizing. The poor gonna be so poor and hungry. You know what I’m saying? It’s gonna be like—There might be some cannibalism out this mothafucka. They might eat the rich.”</p><p>Kendrick, who previously revealed that <a href=#>Tupac once came to him in his sleep</a>, then proceeds to ask the rapper if he sees himself as “somebody that’s rich or somebody that made the best of they own opportunities.”</p><p>“I see myself as a natural born hustler,” Pac says in his response. “A true hustler in every sense of the word. I took nothin’. I took the opportunities. I worked at the most menial and degrading job and built myself up so I could get it to where I owned it. I went from having somebody manage me to me hiring the person that works my management company. I changed everything. I realized my destiny in a matter of five years. You know what I’m saying? And made myself a millionaire. I made millions for a lot of people. Now it’s time to make millions for myself. You know what I’m saying? I made millions for the record companies. I made millions for these movie companies. Now I make millions for us.”</p><p>“Mortal Man” serves as the final track on To Pimp A Butterfly, which was released digitally this week.</p><p>For additional Kendrick Lamar coverage, watch the following DX Daily:</p><p></p>Please enable Javascript to watch this video<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmigmaW1sLzDsWWcp51ku6bD0mignWZjZ4Z4g46toK2klWO4prrDq6Cco12hrq6t0Wagp6yVp8OqsdasZK2toJawbrvNZquoZaCeurF5wGaZrqykmr%2BnuNhmq6uZk6B6rrvRrZilZZ2Wuw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogInfo - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
