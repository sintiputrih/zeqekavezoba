My wife already knew how she was going to be looked at. She’s been through it time and time again. We hope [the judge] slept real good last night. We surely didn’t. Our hearts are broken.”</p><p>Shane claimed that Maryssa “will have to act happy and suck her feelings up, if she can, but a child shouldn’t have to do that.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Evans, 27, and Eason, 31, regained custody of their children on Wednesday, July 3.
