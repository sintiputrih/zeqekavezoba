The transition has been much easier for me because I am working with Aaron Sorkin, who is a playwright, really. He writes so theatrically for television. It was also a fairly gentle transition because I’m working with so many talented theater actors in this show.”</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>BEGINNINGS IN PERFORMANCE</strong></p><p class=dh>Sadoski grew up in Texas with his family, dropped out of college after one semester, and devoted himself to studying acting at drama school after moving to New York.
